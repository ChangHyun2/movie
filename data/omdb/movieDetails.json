In Jordan, a different kind of change is underway as tens of thousands of refugees pour across the border from Palestine. Having been separated from his father in the chaos of war, Tarek, 11, and his mother Ghaydaa, are amongst this latest wave of refugees. Placed in \"temporary\" refugee camps made up of tents and prefab houses until they would be able to return, they wait, like the generation before them who arrived in 1948. With difficulties adjusting to life in Harir camp and a longing to be reunited with his father, Tarek searches a way out, and discovers a new hope emerging with the times. Eventually his free spirit and curious nature lead him to a group of people on a journey that will change their lives. When I Saw You is the story of people affected by the times around them, in search of something more in their lives. A journey full of adventure, love, humor, and the desire to be free.

Because Juliette knows Jean-Marc, who is determined to get rid of Sandra, influenced the vote by scare mongering through misinformation, Juliette and Sandra, at the end of the working day on Friday, are able to convince Dumont to hold another secret ballot on Monday morning, with Sandra needing a majority to keep her job, meaning nine votes.

The city of Brussels, plagued by high rates of youth unemployment, is home to nearly forty street gangs, and the number of young people drawn into the city's gang culture increases each year. It's in this criminal milieu that directing duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah set Black, a pulse-pounding contemporary take on a Shakespearean tragedy. Worlds collide when Mavela (Martha Canga Antonio), a teenage girl with ties to Brussels' Black Bronx gang, meets Marwan (Aboubakr Bensaihi), a member of a rival Moroccan gang, at a police station. Keenly aware of the consequences of getting involved with someone from another gang, they at first resist their attraction to one another, but they can only resist for so long. Just when they've started to imagine a different life for themselves, a terrifying incident reminds Mavela where she belongs - and, more precisely, to whom. In order to break free, Mavela and Marwan will have to betray the very loyalties on which their gangs are founded. And they know what lies ahead for them if they don't. El Arbi and Fallah's film moves forward at an electrifying pace, with furious energy and a gritty realism reminiscent of epic gangster films like City of God and Goodfellas. Ricocheting from moments of extreme tenderness to scenes of extreme violence, and enhanced by the raw performances of its young leads, Black is a full-on, no-holds-barred experience that will resonate long after you've left the cinema.","Language":"French, Dutch, Arabic, Lingala","Country":"Belgium","Awards":"12 wins & 12 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0OTIwMjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk0ODUzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"60%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"4,506","imdbID":"tt4008758","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b64f7082-9c97-4517-865d-fe6235085f60":{"Title":"Lost River","Year":"2014","Rated":"R","Released":"10 Apr 2015","Runtime":"95 min","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Mystery","Director":"Ryan Gosling","Writer":"Ryan Gosling","Actors":"Christina Hendricks, Iain De Caestecker, Matt Smith","Plot":"This movie is a dark fairy tale about love, family, and the fight for survival in the face of danger.

Child's Pose is based on the sense of loss of parents who have to send their children away-physically and psychologically. The parent-child relationship is re-assessed through a son in his 30s that wants to escape from his mother, who in turn wants to keep her adult son by her side. The mother's character is quite familiar, but this film is unique in that the director delicately portrays how the controlling mother wants to deny that her son is destined to leave her by following the characters' emotional flows and gazing at their twisted desires. Luminita Gheorghiu turns in an extraordinary performance in playing a mother struggling to \"save\" her son. Heading to the conclusion, the film shows that the unhealthy mother-son relationship is not that simple when it comes to matters of humane duty.","Language":"Romanian","Country":"Romania","Awards":"13 wins & 8 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzIwNzEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzNzI5MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"77/100"}],"Metascore":"77","imdbRating":"7.4","imdbVotes":"8,706","imdbID":"tt2187115","Type":"movie","DVD":"10 Aug 2016","BoxOffice":"$97,170","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"4aa15412-950b-49d9-98e9-b604dd372ff1":{"Title":"California Dreamin'","Year":"2007","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"23 Jan 2009","Runtime":"155 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, War","Director":"Cristian Nemescu","Writer":"Catherine Linstrum, Cristian Nemescu, Tudor Voican","Actors":"Armand Assante, Jamie Elman, Razvan Vasilescu","Plot":"In 1999, during the Kosovo War,a train carrying NATO equipment, escorted by American Marines with Captain Doug Jones in command, is held back in Capalnita, a Romanian godforsaken village, by Doiaru, the station master, who blocks the train over a paperwork technicality.

He performs his duties with great zeal, and yet he is unduly dismissed. His ego is badly hurt. His experience with clandestine work makes him realize a simple fact - the system of the political police is flawed by nature. Secrecy is both, its power and weakness. The system depends on the presumed authenticity of the agents and recruitment of informants based on fear. The operations of the secret police could be imitated by rogue individuals posing as agents. Batko creates a phantom secret-police department - a back door in the matrix of political control. He becomes the spider in his own web of informants by recruiting a group of intellectuals to spy on each other. He builds his own secret archive. After the fall of communism, Batko uses it to wreak havoc on the government. This is a dark political comedy. A self-styled secret agent engineers a fake political institution that replicates and mocks the omnipotent system of the secret police. A bold political con is launched by a seemingly ridiculous man. His creation becomes a Trojan horse in the apparatus of fear, causing general chaos and making the system look like one stupendous absurdity. The movie offers a paradoxical twist in the standard representation of totalitarianism as a society of victims and victimizers. This is a story without innocents. It exposes the maniacal desire to collaborate and the pleasure of spying on others, the temptation to conform and at the same time hack the system using its own devices. Secret policing reveals its dark nature not only in its nauseating cruelties, but most suggestively in its deviant pleasures.","Language":"Bulgarian","Country":"Bulgaria","Awards":"11 wins & 9 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNiNjQxNDAtZGQ3YS00YmY2LTllZDktMWQzZWNhN2I1ZjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk1NzE0MTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"441","imdbID":"tt2311822","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"1e08bd87-25b0-4a1e-a01e-f9e50ca39e36":{"Title":"The Professor","Year":"2018","Rated":"R","Released":"17 May 2019","Runtime":"90 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Wayne Roberts","Writer":"Wayne Roberts","Actors":"Johnny Depp, Rosemarie DeWitt, Odessa Young","Plot":"After learning about his terminal diagnosis, a college professor decides to live his life to the fullest by drinking, smoking and expressing real thoughts for the people around him.

Like Burnham did more than a decade ago, 13-year-old Kayla turns to YouTube to express herself, where she makes advice blogs in which she pretends to have it all together. In reality, Kayla is sullen and silent around her single father and her peers at school, carrying out most of her interactions with her classmates on Instagram and Twitter. Her YouTube videos are a clever narrative tool that provide insight into her inner hopes and dreams, much like an inspirational online diary.

The parents have passed their socialist and survivalist ideals to their children. Ben considers most of Western society to be fascist, especially corporate America. He also believes that no one will or should be there for you, so you'd better learn how to take care of yourself. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training; know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains, and even fractures; and know how to hunt, forage, and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however, within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie's health. Formerly an attorney, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben believes that this disorder started with her postpartum depression with Bo. Yet Leslie's condition has worsened. Despite not believing in Western medicine, Ben sends Leslie to a hospital close to Ben's sister, Harper, so that there can be family close by. While hospitalized, Leslie commits suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie's act brings out a battle between Ben and Leslie's father, Jack Bertrang, a Christian who not only blames Ben for Leslie's death, but believes that what he is doing \"to\" the children can legally be considered abuse. Jack takes over the funeral arrangements as per his and his complacent wife Abby's Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie's wishes, as she believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, Ben and the children believe it is their mission to honor Leslie's last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophy. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long dormant issues between the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","Language":"English, Esperanto, German, Chinese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 15 wins & 51 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTM0OTY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcxOTQ3ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"83%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"228,364","imdbID":"tt3553976","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 Oct 2016","BoxOffice":"$5,879,835","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"0f8cba0b-c41e-4d36-bd45-780f45527ea2":{"Title":"Inside Llewyn Davis","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"10 Jan 2014","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Drama, Music","Director":"Ethan Coen, Joel Coen","Writer":"Joel Coen, Ethan Coen","Actors":"Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, John Goodman","Plot":"Follow a week in the life of a young folk singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.

His extended family - namely he and his many cousins - own 25,000 acres of undeveloped land on Kauai held in trust, which ends in seven years. The easiest thing for the family to do is sell the land before the seven years is up, which is all the talk in the state, as, to whom they sell the property could very well change the face of Kauai. Despite the vast wealth that comes with the land, Matt has decided to live solely on what he earns as a Honolulu lawyer. However, Matt has not had a perfect life living in Hawaiian paradise as many believe. He and his wife Elizabeth were having problems in their marriage. She recently got into a boating accident which has placed her in a coma. Their seventeen year old daughter Alex is in boarding school on the big island since they couldn't handle her rebellion, which was made all the worse by an argument of an unknown nature between mother and daughter during Alex's last visit home. And their ten year old daughter Scottie is starting to act out, which Matt doesn't know if he can handle, potentially raising her on his own. Matt decides to bring Alex home upon news that Elizabeth is brain dead, and that she will be pulled off life support. But revelations about Elizabeth and Alex's argument, which is tied indirectly to the issue of the land sale, leads to some decisions on Matt's part about what is best for him in both mourning Elizabeth's death and what is the best thing to do about the land, the two decisions which may be incompatible.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 148 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTA1MTcyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyODczNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"246,752","imdbID":"tt1033575","Type":"movie","DVD":"25 Nov 2015","BoxOffice":"$82,584,160","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"ef40789f-cd47-481b-90c1-b36d241c8167":{"Title":"Freeheld","Year":"2015","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"10 Feb 2016","Runtime":"103 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Director":"Peter Sollett","Writer":"Ron Nyswaner","Actors":"Julianne Moore, Elliot Page, Steve Carell","Plot":"New Jersey police lieutenant Laurel Hester and her registered domestic partner Stacie Andree battle to secure Hester's pension benefits when she is diagnosed with terminal cancer.","Language":"English","Country":"United States, United Kingdom, France","Awards":"1 win & 10 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5NTg3NjU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzAwMjA3NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"50%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"50/100"}],"Metascore":"50","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"12,999","imdbID":"tt1658801","Type":"movie","DVD":"19 Jan 2016","BoxOffice":"$546,201","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"c870bc50-8247-4889-9122-89a19e296ad9":{"Title":"The Meyerowitz Stories","Year":"2017","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"13 Oct 2017","Runtime":"112 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Noah Baumbach","Writer":"Noah Baumbach","Actors":"Adam Sandler, Grace Van Patten, Dustin Hoffman","Plot":"An estranged family gathers together in New York City for an event celebrating the artistic work of their father.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"4 wins & 8 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MTA1MjU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAwMzE2MzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"79/100"}],"Metascore":"79","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"52,732","imdbID":"tt5536736","Type":"movie","DVD":"13 Oct 2017","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"f3172a9f-6f8a-40d4-b81b-81f497875e46":{"Title":"Leave No Trace","Year":"2018","Rated":"PG","Released":"29 Jun 2018","Runtime":"109 min","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Director":"Debra Granik","Writer":"Debra Granik, Anne Rosellini, Peter Rock","Actors":"Thomasin McKenzie, Ben Foster, Jeffery Rifflard","Plot":"Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), have lived off the grid for years in the forests of Portland, Oregon.

Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","Language":"English, Spanish, Portuguese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 132 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg4ZmY1MmItMjFjOS00ZTg2LWJjNDYtNDM2YmM2NzhiNmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzMTY4MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"92/100"}],"Metascore":"92","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"122,380","imdbID":"tt5649144","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$5,904,366","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"7f4a2169-6cab-4d69-9b63-720199cdb233":{"Title":"Tiger Theory","Year":"2016","Rated":"N/A","Released":"31 Mar 2016","Runtime":"107 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Radek Bajgar","Writer":"Radek Bajgar, Mirka Zlatníková","Actors":"Jirí Bartoska, Eliska Balzerová, Tatiana Dyková","Plot":"The last drop for Jan's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, whose strength and patience ran dry.

That all changed in June, 2011 when he was forced to resign in disgrace after admitting that he did tweet lewd \"headless\" photos of himself from his public Twitter account to women he met online, and that it was not the work of a hacker or that the photos were of someone else. At the time, his wife Huma Abedin, herself a key aide to Hillary Clinton, was pregnant with their first child, she who decided to stand by her man. Two years later with Abedin still by his side, Weiner tries to resurrect his political career in a run for New York City mayor. He realizes that he has an uphill battle not only because of the known previously tweeted photos, but that there are other lewd photos from that era that may also come to light during the campaign. Regardless of the 2011 resignation, Weiner may not want to admit that any wrongdoing in his personal life should affect his ability to do his job as a politician, congressman, mayor or otherwise. He is probably well aware that the behavior associated with the tweeted photos will dog him during the entire election campaign - with some voters not caring what he does in his personal life, some never willing to forgive or forget such behavior, and some in the middle, those who he has to convince to vote for him. But will the collective \"they\" - including his campaign staff and Abedin - care and forgive a second time around if the behavior has continued, especially if he did or does not own up to it?","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award8 wins & 54 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxODA4NjE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg4MTc3ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"10,418","imdbID":"tt5278596","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Nov 2016","BoxOffice":"$1,676,108","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"7f1c93df-e1c7-4a8e-b1dd-2c5db1c164ff":{"Title":"Mudbound","Year":"2017","Rated":"R","Released":"17 Nov 2017","Runtime":"134 min","Genre":"Drama, War","Director":"Dee Rees","Writer":"Virgil Williams, Dee Rees, Hillary Jordan","Actors":"Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke","Plot":"In the aftermath of WWII, somewhere in the muddy Mississippi Delta, two families--one black, the Jacksons, and the other white, the McAllans--are forced to share the same patch of land, keeping a frail race-based peace with each other.

A cinematographic investigation through the sense of love in our days. The virtues, wonders and novelties of our time. A delicate poetry in which, attending about love, avoid the commonplace, collapsing in a violent adventure between beauty, passion, anger and madness.

Emblematic events connect curiosity, away from a conventional approach of watching a film. There's no hero or villain, at the contrary the director includes a freestyle technique plenty of dance, music, philosophy and art, avoiding the tedious didacticism. A journey through the twists of our hearts beheld in a critical and poetical vision. tantalizing mixture of cinematographic styles. A true pair of wings that releases imagination.

Suddenly, you can see their unconsciousness, representing the contemporary neurosis. Parables and weaknesses lived on the conflict in bonding with someone. Shocks and promises of unconditional love and the search for self-love. The director works the taboos that people deny on the couch of a psychologist. In a strong and virile handling, the film risks bravely by the meanings of feelings. Fear, shame, failure, moral, religion and ideology. Trends that gather the formation of man and his history. Themes not often explored in the last bit of Brazilian films. A different work of art, from the cast through the editing, opposed to nostalgia and homage.

A film made by controversy and noise.","Language":"Portuguese","Country":"Brazil","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI2ZjM0ZDItN2JjNS00MzAxLTlhOGYtNTJlZDg2MDM4NzU4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU1OTQ2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"N/A","imdbID":"tt2471354","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"67e202f6-6e03-4a89-a42b-b852e84c04e3":{"Title":"Guava Island","Year":"2019","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"13 Apr 2019","Runtime":"55 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Director":"Hiro Murai","Writer":"Donald Glover, Stephen Glover, Ibra Ake","Actors":"Donald Glover, Rihanna, Letitia Wright","Plot":"Small time musician Deni Maroon and his loving girlfriend, Kofi Novia, live on a beautiful but impoverished small tropical island called Guava Island that's controlled by a brutal paramilitary group, Red Cargo.

Busby Berkeley, Cirque de Soleil, Circus freaks, and human farm animals all make appearances in this hallucinogenic tale of love and comeuppance.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"2 wins & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk5MjVmYWItY2U2Mi00ZmU4LWJkODItZTQxNjkzMDUzYmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ4NDY5OTc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"4.9/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"4.9","imdbVotes":"337","imdbID":"tt1588898","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"31aa5da9-8b38-4712-a042-3400be806fe8":{"Title":"2030","Year":"2014","Rated":"N/A","Released":"09 Oct 2014","Runtime":"98 min","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Director":"Minh Nguyen-Vo","Writer":"Minh Nguyen-Vo","Actors":"Quynh Hoa, Quy Binh, Kim Long Thach","Plot":"In a near future Vietnam where global warming and rising seawater levels have forced cultivation to be done on floating farms, a strong-willed woman has to make a critical decision about her ex-lover, a suspect of her husband's murder.","Language":"Vietnamese","Country":"Vietnam, United States","Awards":"2 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY1ODIyNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjA1MzIwMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"121","imdbID":"tt3336930","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"f48156cd-ef75-4fec-9672-7e6a8b1438d4":{"Title":"Big Father, Small Father and Other Stories","Year":"2015","Rated":"N/A","Released":"20 Apr 2016","Runtime":"102 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Director":"Dang Di Phan","Writer":"Dang Di Phan","Actors":"Thi Hai Yen Do, Ha Phong Nguyen, Hoang Le Cong","Plot":"It is the late nineties, Vietnam is in economic turmoil and overpopulation has sparked political concern.

Thereafter, rumour has it that Hong Kong's three most notorious mobsters, known in the underworld as the \"Three Kings of Thieves\", are plotting together to score a final hit before the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong. However, none are initially aware of the rumour. Yip is living as a fugitive after a gunfight with the Royal Hong Kong Police. He now makes his fortunes by smuggling counterfeit electronics. Powerful and prestigious in the past, Yip must now grovel to high Chinese officials. Although successful in his business, he becomes depressed. When the rumour comes to him, he feels the urge to give up everything and pick up his gun once again to join forces with the others. Kwai is very cautious and uses several pseudonyms to hide his identity. Although the scale of his crimes is nowhere as large as Yip's and Cheuk's, but he has managed to commit repeated robberies that are totally unknown to the police. Small-scale robberies, which have become his expertise, have minimal risk but also little profit. As he hears of the rumour, he realizes that he will make a large fortune by collaborating with Yip and Cheuk. He initially restrains himself and chooses to ignore it. However, Cheuk begins to have second thoughts. Cheuk has recently abducted the son of a rich tycoon and successfully extorted a ransom, all while under police surveillance. Wanting to raise the bar for himself, he hears about the rumour and becomes obsessed with the idea, going to extreme lengths to seek out Yip and Kwai.","Language":"Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai","Country":"Hong Kong, China","Awards":"11 wins & 13 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc3NDMyMmMtYjg1My00NDU5LTkzZmItZmE5OTYzMjE4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI1NTU1Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"2,368","imdbID":"tt4379800","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Apr 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"65889377-ba20-4142-879c-b0b51bde83b2":{"Title":"Operation Mekong","Year":"2016","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"30 Sep 2016","Runtime":"123 min","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Director":"Dante Lam","Writer":"Dante Lam, Kang-Kei Chu, Siu-Kwan Lau","Actors":"Hanyu Zhang, Eddie Peng, Baoguo Chen","Plot":"Two Chinese merchant ships were attacked in Mekong river and 13 crews were killed.

But revelations about Elizabeth and Alex's argument, which is tied indirectly to the issue of the land sale, leads to some decisions on Matt's part about what is best for him in both mourning Elizabeth's death and what is the best thing to do about the land, the two decisions which may be incompatible.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 148 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTA1MTcyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyODczNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"246,752","imdbID":"tt1033575","Type":"movie","DVD":"25 Nov 2015","BoxOffice":"$82,584,160","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"ebd58c8c-db4e-4142-88fe-cc5c66fdb7ba":{"Title":"Soul Surfer","Year":"2011","Rated":"PG","Released":"08 Apr 2011","Runtime":"112 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Family","Director":"Sean McNamara","Writer":"Sean McNamara, Deborah Schwartz, Douglas Schwartz","Actors":"AnnaSophia Robb, Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt","Plot":"13 year-old Bethany Hamilton is a champion surfer who was born to be in the water.

A decade after that humiliating night, they remain rooted to the bottom of FIFA's World rankings, having scored only twice in seventeen years. They have lost every competitive game they have ever played. Against this backdrop of serial underachievement, the team face the daunting prospect of a qualification campaign for the upcoming 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It would take a miracle-maker or a madman to turn the team's fortunes around - and in maverick Dutch coach Thomas Rongen the islanders somehow find both. As a loan appointment from the mighty U.S. Soccer Federation, with experience of playing alongside football greats like George Best and Johann Cruyff, Rongen is completely unprepared for what greets him on the island - in his own words it is \"by far the lowest standard\" of football he's ever seen, with only half of his team even fit enough to play a whole game. A lack of athleticism aside, Rongen's ailing squad contains the emotionally scarred goalkeeper who conceded 31 goals against Australia a decade earlier and a member of Samoa's third gender, the fa'fafine, who lives 24/7 as a woman. To complicate matters further the team's best player has been posted 6000 miles away by the US military. With the team about to embark on a grueling World Cup Qualification campaign, Rongen has just one month to transform this ragtag of losers into a winning team - and perhaps learn a little about himself along the way.","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"2 wins & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODcxOTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU0NTg1MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"2,774","imdbID":"tt2446600","Type":"movie","DVD":"22 Jul 2014","BoxOffice":"$43,089","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b6ce1b1f-88e3-4f9e-84a8-134bbb0c392e":{"Title":"Paradise Broken","Year":"2011","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"14 Oct 2011","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Director":"James Sereno","Writer":"Chris McKinney, Chris McKinney","Actors":"Dante Basco, Nadine Nicole, Khalil Kain","Plot":"Ray and Misha's one bedroom apartment, only a half-a-mile from Waikiki Beach, feels a world away from the white sandy beaches and crystal blue waters of Honolulu.

These are the pink sari-clad women of the Gulabi Gang, who use words as weapons - demanding their rights, submitting petitions and haranguing corrupt officials. They travel long distances by cart and tractor, bus and train, to wrest justice for women and dalits, undeterred by sneering policemen and condescending bureaucrats. Sampat Pal, the group's founder, is a rough-and-tough woman with a commanding personality. Despite being born into a traditional family and married off early, she has evolved her own brand of feminism and egalitarian politics. Constantly on the move, today she may be found investigating the suspicious death of a young woman, tomorrow protesting against a corrupt official. The Gulabi Gang, with a membership of thousands, is active across many districts. Suman Singh, one of the leaders, has made it her personal mission to send a land-grabbing village chief behind bars, along with his murderous henchmen. But what's to be done when the brother of a fellow activist carries out an \"honour killing\"? Husna, a longtime member, is forced to choose between family loyalties and all that their fragile movement stands for. The Gang is still very new, and many of its members still steeped in conservative values. A whole village connives in protecting the perpetrators of violence, aided by those in power. Everywhere, the Gang encounters resistance to its notions of gender equality and efforts for social change. The film pulls us into the centre of all these blazing conflicts: we are moved by the women's courage and determination, while their frustrations and disappointments mirror our own. As it travels with them through the dusty and desolate landscape, Gulabi Gang uncovers a complex story, disturbing yet heartening.","Language":"Hindi","Country":"Norway, India, Denmark","Awards":"8 wins & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Njg5MDEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMTc5Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"226","imdbID":"tt2196638","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"74ff366d-922c-4c0d-84fb-0587802a8b7b":{"Title":"Black City Lights: Not Enough (For Us)","Year":"2014","Rated":"N/A","Released":"17 Aug 2014","Runtime":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Music","Director":"Amanda Öman","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Jimmy Roye-Dunne","Plot":"N/A","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhiYTNmNDMtYzc4MC00OGQ0LWI5ZWQtZmVlN2FmMGVmNTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTExNzg5OTI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"N/A","imdbID":"tt4536826","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"77e1336d-0301-481c-b8d2-d4a241c3831c":{"Title":"Mahayoddha Rama","Year":"2016","Rated":"N/A","Released":"04 Nov 2016","Runtime":"106 min","Genre":"Animation","Director":"Rohit Jaising Vaid","Writer":"Javed Akhtar, Varun Grover, Rahul Patel","Actors":"Kunal Kapoor, Jimmy Shergill, Gulshan Grover","Plot":"Mahayoddha Rama retells the great epic of Hindu god, Rama. in this epic, Rama is born to king Dashrath and as an adult fights the 10-headed demon Ravanna.","Language":"Hindi","Country":"India","Awards":"1 win","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxZWU2MWUtZjE3MC00YTU1LTgyY2QtYzU1Yjk4NzIxNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjM4Mjk1MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"48","imdbID":"tt1479690","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"bbf2b893-4534-43d2-a7ee-82d7dc316cc1":{"Title":"Gul Makai","Year":"2020","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"24 Jan 2020","Runtime":"132 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Director":"Amjad Khan","Writer":"Bhaswati Chakrabarty, Suneel Sagar, Ganesh K Yadav","Actors":"Reem Shaikh, Divya Dutta, Atul Kulkarni","Plot":"Fear is like an elastic band.

Based on a tip from Lacchu (Jaspal Sharma), he and his men descend to Brahmpuri village. A marriage is taking place in this hamlet where the groom is about to get a huge amount of gold and cash. Man Singh and his gang reaches the marriage venue in order to loot this wealth. However, the cops, led by Virender Gujjar (Ashutosh Rana) ambush the gang. In the tough fight, Man Singh and half of the gang get killed. Vakil, Lakhna and others escape. Vakil, now the leader of the gang, accuses Lakhna of betraying them and calling the cops. Lakhna is fed up of being a rebel and wants to surrender. Meanwhile, as they are running from the cops, they bump into Indumati Tomar (Bhumi Pednekar). She's accompanied by her sister Sonchiriya (Khushiya) who has been brutally raped. Sonchiriya needs to be taken to the hospital urgently and she asks for Vakil's help. The gang agrees. They halt to seek blessings of their goddess at a temple where Indu's husband and other family members arrive. She is accused of killing her father-in-law and they ask the gang to hand over Indu and Sonchiriya. Vakil agrees but Lakhna realizes it's not just and hence revolts.

Tantri experiences a magical journey and an emotional relationship through body expressions, finding herself between reality and imagination, loss and hope.","Language":"Indonesian, Balinese","Country":"Indonesia, Netherlands, Australia, Qatar","Awards":"10 wins & 31 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYzNGQ5YmQtOTEzMy00MTk5LTk5Y2MtNjliYzI1NTc4OWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc2NTQ1MTI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"390","imdbID":"tt7215548","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"86549f41-86cd-4cc7-9292-9f2587b35bfe":{"Title":"27 Steps of May","Year":"2018","Rated":"N/A","Released":"27 Apr 2019","Runtime":"112 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Ravi L.

His trouble with the law, coupled with an escalating war between a local drug lord, creates a tense standoff: both sides are closing in, and Kunene must stay one step ahead--or his empire, and his life, will come crashing down.","Language":"English, Afrikaans","Country":"South Africa","Awards":"6 wins & 1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTkyMzMzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczNDk0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"77%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"53/100"}],"Metascore":"53","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"10,784","imdbID":"tt0783532","Type":"movie","DVD":"15 Dec 2010","BoxOffice":"$7,294","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"d4c6b91d-6221-4f97-ac8f-9aff87149045":{"Title":"Winnie Mandela","Year":"2011","Rated":"R","Released":"06 Sep 2013","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Director":"Darrell Roodt","Writer":"Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob, André Pieterse, Darrell Roodt","Actors":"Jennifer Hudson, Terrence Howard, Elias Koteas","Plot":"A drama that chronicles the life of Winnie Mandela from her childhood through her marriage and her husband's incarceration.","Language":"English, Xhosa","Country":"South Africa, Canada","Awards":"3 wins & 7 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMTI4NjM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk0MjIwMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"19%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"37/100"}],"Metascore":"37","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"870","imdbID":"tt1551641","Type":"movie","DVD":"13 Jan 2015","BoxOffice":"$80,634","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"77b67d7e-c849-4dc9-b5fa-7ceb7473378c":{"Title":"Zulu","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"31 Aug 2020","Runtime":"110 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Director":"Jérôme Salle","Writer":"Caryl Ferey, Julien Rappeneau, Jérôme Salle","Actors":"Orlando Bloom, Forest Whitaker, Conrad Kemp","Plot":"As a child, Ali Neuman narrowly escaped being murdered by Inkatha, a militant political party at war with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. Only he and his mother survived the carnage of those years. But as with many survivors, the psychological scars remain. Today, Ali is chief of the homicide branch of the South African police in Cape Town. One of his staff is Brian Epkeen, a free-wheeling white officer whose family was originally involved in the establishment of apartheid but who works well with Neuman. Together they have to deal with crime that inevitably exists in sprawling areas of un- and under- employed people, crime exacerbated by gangs, both local and from other parts of Africa. Their job gets even more difficult when the corpses of two young women are found. A new evil has been introduced in the city and a new drug has been introduced to its residents, including both murder victims. At the chaotic crossroads where brutality and modernization collide, the echoes of apartheid still resound in the shadows of a society struggling toward reconciliation.","Language":"Xhosa, Zulu, English, Afrikaans","Country":"France, South Africa","Awards":"2 wins","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0NjE1OTI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyNTM3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"19,551","imdbID":"tt2249221","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Sep 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"8e973cf6-e6a2-45b5-93ae-44fa90169e3a":{"Title":"A Million Colours","Year":"2011","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"N/A","Runtime":"115 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Peter Bishai","Writer":"Peter Bishai, André Pieterse","Actors":"Wandile Molebatsi, Jason Hartman, Masello Motana","Plot":"A story of love and friendship set against the violence of Apartheid in South Africa.

It is exactly the opposite of their township- a place under a constant and growing threat from political violence, driven by Inkatha hostel dwellers on one side and township United Democratic Front comrades on the other. Soon, everyone recognizes that Otelo is gifted on the water, a god in waiting for his purpose. An older white man, Kurt Struely, approaches the boys, certain of their potential and invites them to his home to watch some professional surfers on video. He paints them an enticing picture of the life to be had, if they can master every kind of break - money for nothing and the chicks for free. The boys practice and, under Struely's watchful eye, become really good. Otelo outshines his teacher, Tau, who begins to resent the obvious natural talent of his friend. His resentment builds even more when Dezi, New Year's younger sister, falls for Otelo. When Struely enters the boys into their first 'localism' competition, Tau persuades his cousin, Stembiso, to look after Ntwe at the township pool where the boys learnt to swim. But while the boys are carving out new paradigms on the water, Tau breaks his prized surfing board and Ntwe is burnt to death with a tire necklace as a suspected informer for the apartheid security police. When Otelo, with New Year's help, discovers the truth behind his younger brother's death, he has to make a choice between the money, glamour, girls and superstardom of international surfdom and justice for Ntwe. On the day Nelson Mandela steps out of prison for the first time in 27 years, what this boy chooses will resonate for audiences everywhere. He whisks her off and they spend a day of pure joy and freedom. For a moment, Anna forgets her predicament. But there is one problem. He does not have a South African passport. Now Anna must choose: between marrying for the sake of personal freedom, or loving even if it means having to leave.","Language":"English, Zulu","Country":"South Africa","Awards":"3 wins & 17 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3Mzk4NjY5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2ODQwOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"67%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"60/100"}],"Metascore":"60","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"82","imdbID":"tt1986926","Type":"movie","DVD":"14 Jan 2014","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"3806290a-dd82-4100-81d6-da769396f76e":{"Title":"Love by Chance","Year":"2017","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"02 May 2017","Runtime":"105 min","Genre":"Comedy","Director":"Samad Davis","Writer":"Samad Davis, Dani Renee","Actors":"Stevie Baggs Jr., Desi Banks, Cory Chapman","Plot":"Two aspiring South African actors who are independently in America eager to crack into an extremely difficult and over saturated Hollywood industry, meet by chance.

Strangers, each on their own mission with a simple task to complete and in search of family to help them. But when they are betrayed by the very people whose protection they sought, they find themselves trapped in the city, invisible and alone. Vaya interweaves three separate plots that intersect and intertwine in a gripping, deeply moving, and often funny narrative about struggling for survival and dignity in the city. In the first story, a rural man has been promised a job by his big-city cousin; his earnings will allow him to pay lobola back home, which will change his life forever. He's excited; his cousin is an important man whose patronage the village has relied on for many years. To work for him is a great honour. But on arrival he discovers that the job is not quite what he thought: He is required to kill his cousin's rival. In the second story, a young man is sent to Jozi to reclaim his father's body, but he discovers that the body has already been claimed: his father's hitherto-unknown 'city family' has taken it and they are not giving it back. The young man must find a way to return the body to his rural home or risk the family reputation forever. In the third story, a young woman takes her aunt's young daughter to Joburg to live with her mother for the first time, but she has her own plans to dump the child and finally escape the boredom of rural life to explore her own dreams and ambitions in the city.

Most long-suffering is Anna, the matriarch of the family. Who's really loved by her husband, but when her children are around she has to suffer his intolerance and volatile moods. After nearly sinking in his old fishing boat, Hannes begins to soften and he and Anna have a rapprochement - which is almost immediately halted by tragedy when Anna has a very severe stroke.What follows is a deeply moving study of how Hannes comes to terms with what life has given him: to take care of wife at home instead of in a nursing home. The 'volcano' is actually Hannes himself, a seemingly cold and gray man with his emotions in tumult within about to erupt.","Language":"Icelandic","Country":"Iceland, Denmark","Awards":"15 wins & 14 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTUwNDU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5OTE1NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"1,500","imdbID":"tt1695831","Type":"movie","DVD":"27 Mar 2014","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"a36adf92-42a7-4847-8f7e-67f61ff8c816":{"Title":"Homeward","Year":"2020","Rated":"TV-G","Released":"25 Feb 2020","Runtime":"81 min","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Director":"Michael Johnson","Writer":"Aaron Witlin, David Michael Latt","Actors":"Joey Lawrence, James Cullen Bressack, Kim Little","Plot":"A boastful elf and his prank-happy orc brother must learn to work together to stop a fiendish orc gang from retrieving a magical stone that will give them the power to take over the world.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2YTIwNjctZWUyZS00YTkyLTg4YTctODdkZjIxMmJhZWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxOTAxNzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"2.5/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"2.5","imdbVotes":"427","imdbID":"tt11766318","Type":"movie","DVD":"25 Feb 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"2238af5d-d46b-4e3e-aee2-46e867480e84":{"Title":"The Stronghold","Year":"2017","Rated":"N/A","Released":"12 Oct 2017","Runtime":"111 min","Genre":"Adventure, Fantasy","Director":"Yuriy Kovalyov","Writer":"Oleksandr Dermanskyi, Yuriy Kovalyov, Yaroslav Voytseshek","Actors":"Danylo Kamenskyi, Eva Koshova, Roman Lutskyi","Plot":"The Stronghold is a Ukrainian adventure/fantasy film based on the same-name book.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 37 wins & 81 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MThhN2EtZjMzNC00ZDJmLThiZTgtNThlY2UxZWMzNjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"460,632","imdbID":"tt1596363","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$70,259,870","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"3ffe39c8-143c-48df-aeae-da5f6071519c":{"Title":"Date Night","Year":"2010","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"09 Apr 2010","Runtime":"88 min","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Director":"Shawn Levy","Writer":"Josh Klausner","Actors":"Steve Carell, Tina Fey, Mark Wahlberg","Plot":"Phil and Claire Foster are a couple who have been married for several years.

Despite the victory, Portuguese and British are forced to retreat from the enemy, numerically superior, in order to attract them to Torres Vedras, where Wellington had built fortified lines hardly surmountable. Simultaneously, the Anglo-Portuguese command organizes the evacuation of the entire territory between the battlefield and the lines of Torres Vedras, a gigantic burned land operation, which prevents the French from collecting supplies. This is the setting for the adventures of a multitude of characters from all social backgrounds - soldiers and civilians, men, women and children, young and old - to the daily routine torn by war and dragged through hills and valleys, between ruined villages, charred forests and devastated crops.Highly persecuted by the French, already tormented by an unmerciful weather, the mass of fugitives continues to move forward clenching the teeth, just to save their skin, loaded with tenacious will to resist the invaders and retreat them from their country. Or even hoping to take advantage of the disarray to satisfy their basic instincts. All of them, whatever nature or motivations - the idealistic young lieutenant Pedro De Alencar, Clarissa Warren, the malicious little English girl, the shady dealer Penabranca, the vindictive Sergeant Francisco Xavier or the lusty prostitute Martírio, all gather by different paths to the lines of Torres, where the final battle will decide the fate of each one of them.","Language":"Portuguese, English, French","Country":"Portugal, France","Awards":"9 wins & 18 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFkYWJhODMtNjE3NS00ODY2LWI1ZDAtODJjMDcxNzExMmE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.0","imdbVotes":"1,541","imdbID":"tt1928329","Type":"movie","DVD":"10 Aug 2016","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b58cf7f2-33a7-435f-8ea0-607e3e925706":{"Title":"The Island","Year":"2015","Rated":"N/A","Released":"25 Jul 2015","Runtime":"4 min","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Director":"Trevor Kristjanson, Kevin Tabachnick","Writer":"Trevor Kristjanson","Actors":"Trevor Kristjanson, Alyssa Parker","Plot":"A young couple's relationship is on the rocks.

The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart.

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 3 Oscars. 98 wins & 144 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA5NDZlZGUtMjAxOS00YTRkLTkwYmMtYWQ0NWEwZDZiNjEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"89/100"}],"Metascore":"89","imdbRating":"8.5","imdbVotes":"929,833","imdbID":"tt2582802","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Sep 2016","BoxOffice":"$13,092,000","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"8ed025a6-a793-471b-854f-3a58a4dc7af5":{"Title":"Blade Runner 2049","Year":"2017","Rated":"R","Released":"06 Oct 2017","Runtime":"164 min","Genre":"Action, Drama, Mystery","Director":"Denis Villeneuve","Writer":"Hampton Fancher, Michael Green, Philip K.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 37 wins & 81 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MThhN2EtZjMzNC00ZDJmLThiZTgtNThlY2UxZWMzNjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"460,632","imdbID":"tt1596363","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$70,259,870","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"bb7831de-01de-44ad-a091-b8ba5904187c":{"Title":"The Wolf of Wall Street","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"25 Dec 2013","Runtime":"180 min","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Crime","Director":"Martin Scorsese","Writer":"Terence Winter, Jordan Belfort","Actors":"Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie","Plot":"In the early 1990s, Jordan Belfort teamed with his partner Donny Azoff and started brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont.

These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI's lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 9 wins & 46 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNzcxODg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyNjQ3Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"405,727","imdbID":"tt0840361","Type":"movie","DVD":"20 Jun 2013","BoxOffice":"$92,186,262","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"e816bd67-a6e5-4ec2-8f7a-98e564822f93":{"Title":"Hell or High Water","Year":"2016","Rated":"R","Released":"26 Aug 2016","Runtime":"102 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Director":"David Mackenzie","Writer":"Taylor Sheridan","Actors":"Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges","Plot":"In Texas, after the death of his mother, the unemployed oil and gas worker Toby Howard is losing his ranch to the Texas Midlands Bank.

Danny (Jack Roth), an ordinary working class kid, is angry and frustrated at the rough deal he faces. When he confronts Conrad (Tim Bentinck) a member of today's privileged elite, he aims to teach him and his kind a lesson they will never forget. Holding Conrad and his family hostage in their plush mansion, Danny and his pals force Conrad into a deadly game of chance. Danny's master plan is to kick-start a revolution by streaming attacks against the super-rich one percent on the web. His ultimate goal? To terrify the elite into bringing about change. Danny's cohorts, however, have other ideas - and in a confusing cocktail of terror, deceit and twisting narrative, we are left wondering which side people are on - and everyone's values are questioned. With its visceral energy and unsettling stream of consciousness plot, 'Us and Them' is the antithesis of the safe, cosy British period drama. Writer/director Joe Martin taps into his blue collar roots to capture the zeitgeist of outsider politics that have gripped the western world. In Us and Them he lays bare the inequality and anger that wrong footed the media and led to the shock events of 2016.","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"2 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MwNTAwMDgtN2ZlNC00NGIwLThiMGUtYjUyMTAzMjUzNGZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDYwMzk2Mzg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"62%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"56/100"}],"Metascore":"56","imdbRating":"5.2","imdbVotes":"797","imdbID":"tt3592750","Type":"movie","DVD":"10 Apr 2018","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b079596a-ce24-489f-9e61-e3b6fb87443a":{"Title":"Gone with the Bullets","Year":"2014","Rated":"N/A","Released":"18 Dec 2014","Runtime":"140 min","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Drama","Director":"Wen Jiang","Writer":"Wen Jiang, Shuo Wang, Yimei Liao","Actors":"Wen Jiang, You Ge, Yun Zhou","Plot":"Set in 1920s Shanghai, Ma Zouri and Xiang Feitian establish a notorious beauty pageant called the Flowers Competition.

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan's biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 4 Oscars. 192 wins & 293 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAzNDMxMzAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMjA4MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"87/100"}],"Metascore":"87","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"652,113","imdbID":"tt2562232","Type":"movie","DVD":"01 Aug 2016","BoxOffice":"$42,340,598","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"8fe53c8a-f6b2-410e-a058-d1ef5297dd6d":{"Title":"Brooklyn","Year":"2015","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"25 Nov 2015","Runtime":"117 min","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Director":"John Crowley","Writer":"Nick Hornby, Colm Tóibín","Actors":"Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson","Plot":"Ireland, early 1950s.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 37 wins & 81 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MThhN2EtZjMzNC00ZDJmLThiZTgtNThlY2UxZWMzNjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"460,632","imdbID":"tt1596363","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$70,259,870","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"1d11d509-7084-47fe-bfa1-34147bebf5c1":{"Title":"The Fault in Our Stars","Year":"2014","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"06 Jun 2014","Runtime":"126 min","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Director":"Josh Boone","Writer":"Scott Neustadter, Michael H.

Princess Grace, the former Grace Kelly, has been married to Prince Rainier of Monaco now for five years, they having two young children. Her transition from famed Oscar-winning Hollywood actress from a background as the daughter of a wealthy millionaire owner of a brickworks in Philadelphia to European princess of a small, exclusive and tight-knit principality has been a difficult one, the Monagasques who have been less than welcoming to her in her outspoken American nature. Even in her official charity work as head of a women's committee for the Red Cross, the other committee members largely grumble under their breath about her as their leader. Despite loving Rainier, their marriage is a largely distant one emotionally as he focuses on his role as monarch, now an especially difficult time in the on-going tension between Monaco and France under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle, who would, if he could, annex Monaco back under French control. She has a small entourage of trusted advisers who lead her through the maze of her life, including an American Catholic priest, Father Francis Tucker, currently based in Monaco, and she bringing back into the fold Rupert Allan, who worked as her Hollywood publicist. Despite the unofficial roles of the members of this entourage, Grace has never had official guidance into all that it means to be Princess of Monaco. She has always been courted by the Hollywood community to continue acting, the thoughts of doing so stronger now than ever in her general unhappiness, with a concrete high profile role offered to her by her oft late career collaborator Sir Alfred Hitchcock. She returning to acting would be seen by the Monagasques and probably Rainier as she turning her back on her royal duties.

Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","Language":"English, Spanish, Portuguese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 132 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg4ZmY1MmItMjFjOS00ZTg2LWJjNDYtNDM2YmM2NzhiNmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzMTY4MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"92/100"}],"Metascore":"92","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"122,380","imdbID":"tt5649144","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$5,904,366","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"160e7728-2887-4cdd-8a7a-4e79d2bd982c":{"Title":"The Curse of La Llorona","Year":"2019","Rated":"R","Released":"19 Apr 2019","Runtime":"93 min","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Director":"Michael Chaves","Writer":"Mikki Daughtry, Tobias Iaconis","Actors":"Linda Cardellini, Raymond Cruz, Patricia Velasquez","Plot":"Ignoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother suspected of child endangerment, a social worker and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening supernatural realm.

Whether a shot at redemption or a suicide mission, Jonas must confront his fears and risk his own life and the lives of everyone trapped below on a single question: Could the Carcharodon Megalodon - the largest marine predator that ever existed - still be alive - and on the hunt?","Language":"English, Mandarin, Thai, Japanese","Country":"United States, China","Awards":"5 wins & 6 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMGRmODYtM2NkYS00ZGRlLWE1MWItYjI1MzIwNjQwN2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"47%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"46/100"}],"Metascore":"46","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"194,452","imdbID":"tt4779682","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Oct 2018","BoxOffice":"$145,522,784","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"6b12e9d0-3e26-4526-bcfd-982e9cb694d3":{"Title":"Pain & Gain","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"26 Apr 2013","Runtime":"129 min","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Director":"Michael Bay","Writer":"Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Pete Collins","Actors":"Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Anthony Mackie","Plot":"Based on the true story of Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) a Miami bodybuilder who wants to live the American dream.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 37 wins & 81 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MThhN2EtZjMzNC00ZDJmLThiZTgtNThlY2UxZWMzNjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"460,632","imdbID":"tt1596363","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$70,259,870","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"2658fb0b-bf3e-485c-bd66-a8f767d0489e":{"Title":"The Florida Project","Year":"2017","Rated":"R","Released":"10 Nov 2017","Runtime":"111 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Sean Baker","Writer":"Sean Baker, Chris Bergoch","Actors":"Brooklynn Prince, Bria Vinaite, Willem Dafoe","Plot":"Halley lives with her six year old daughter Moonee in a budget motel along one of the commercial strips catering to the Walt Disney World tourist clientele outside Orlando, Florida. Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","Language":"English, Spanish, Portuguese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 132 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg4ZmY1MmItMjFjOS00ZTg2LWJjNDYtNDM2YmM2NzhiNmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzMTY4MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"92/100"}],"Metascore":"92","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"122,380","imdbID":"tt5649144","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$5,904,366","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"af6347e3-e5ff-45d6-b675-37028a0a664e":{"Title":"Dolphin Tale 2","Year":"2014","Rated":"PG","Released":"12 Sep 2014","Runtime":"107 min","Genre":"Drama, Family","Director":"Charles Martin Smith","Writer":"Charles Martin Smith, Karen Janszen, Noam Dromi","Actors":"Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Nathan Gamble","Plot":"It has been several years since young Sawyer Nelson and the dedicated team at the Clearwater Marine Hospital, headed by Dr. Clay Haskett, rescued Winter.

Shot from 2016 to 2018, The Cave belongs to the top rank of war films. Syrian director Feras Fayyad takes us to a subterranean landscape that feels akin to the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max (1979). With life too dangerous above ground, survivors create a network of secret tunnels under the city of Ghouta, near Damascus, for an underground hospital maintained by women doctors. In contrast to the many Syrian documentaries made from cellphone footage or shaky cameras, Feras Fayyad takes great care to visualize the landscape and its memorable occupants with artful cinematography. For anyone who feels jaded by Syria coverage, this work stands apart. The heart of the film is Dr. Amani, a young Syrian woman operating in unimaginable conditions with great humor and fortitude. When not tending to patients - many of whom are small children - she's forced to justify her work to chauvinistic men who insist that a woman should be at home fulfilling domestic duties, not running a hospital. The claustrophobia of Amani's workplace is mitigated by the high spirits of her crew, while occasional forays above ground temper relief from close quarters with harrowing scenes of a city reduced to rubble.","Language":"Arabic, English","Country":"Denmark, Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Qatar, Syria","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 21 wins & 23 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiZjcxMmMtZGFhOS00MGU4LTk0YTItZGRmZTc0ZmM2Y2MzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzMjQ0MTA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"83/100"}],"Metascore":"83","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"2,892","imdbID":"tt7178226","Type":"movie","DVD":"14 Jan 2020","BoxOffice":"$62,625","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b1b3cd3b-95ba-42bd-9419-edd7dbd0b86e":{"Title":"A Perfect Plan","Year":"2020","Rated":"N/A","Released":"01 May 2020","Runtime":"87 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery","Director":"Jesse D.

Many critics pointed out that theses exhibitions revealed painters that should be ranked amongst the best brazillian artists of the century. It was written that this explosion of art and beauty was a sign that something comparable to the renaissance was happening in Riio de Janeiro. Behind this miracle there was no art academy, patron or dealer, only a psychiatrist, ridiculed by her colleagues, and a painting studio at a mental hospital, in the outskirts of town. The artists were schizophrenic, poor, hospitalized for several decades, abandoned by their families and hopeless according to their doctors.

But before he was famous, before WikiLeaks, before the internet even existed, he was a teenage computer hacker in Melbourne. This is his story. In 1989, known as 'Mendax', Assange and two friends formed a group called the 'International Subversives'. Using early home computers and defining themselves as 'white hat hackers' - those who look but don't steal - they broke into some of the world's most powerful and secretive organisations. They were young, brilliant, and in the eyes of the US Government, a major threat to national security. At the urging of the FBI, the Australian Federal Police set up a special taskforce to catch them. But at a time when most Australian police had never seen a computer, let alone used one, they had to figure out just where to begin. Police ingenuity and old-fashioned detective work are pitted against nimble, highly skilled young men in this new crime frontier. What follows, is a tense and gripping game of cat and mouse through the electronic underground of Melbourne.","Language":"English","Country":"Australia","Awards":"1 win & 6 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMTg4MTIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUwNDM1MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"2,057","imdbID":"tt2357453","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"19f427f0-1fb9-4a04-b0df-12b7bb39a5b5":{"Title":"Ninguém Entra, Ninguém Sai","Year":"2017","Rated":"N/A","Released":"04 May 2017","Runtime":"83 min","Genre":"Comedy","Director":"Hsu Chien Hsin","Writer":"Paulo Halm, Ludmila Naves, Luis Fernando Verissimo","Actors":"Catarina Abdalla, Karolina Albertassi, Monique Alfradique","Plot":"An unexpected event surprises couples during their love affairs at a motel.

Group readings of holy writings, sermons, purifying immersion: Divine Love has everything you'd find in your average run-of-the-mill evangelical community, except that this group also likes to get involved in a bit of swinging - on the sole condition that the man's seed is reserved for his legitimate wife because \"supreme pleasure comes from the divine desire to procreate life within the family. But Joana and Danilo are unable to conceive, because he is unable to reach a climax, despite his best efforts (swinging upside down on a machine being one of them). As a result, she has entirely dedicated her existence to God in the hope of a miracle (going up to pray regularly at an astonishing religious drive-in). But when the miracle becomes a reality, everything begins to get a little complicated.","Language":"Portuguese","Country":"Brazil, Uruguay, Denmark, Norway, Chile, Sweden","Awards":"5 wins & 25 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM2MDlmYzktMzQ0Ny00NmFkLTlkZWYtY2E0NzgxM2MxNjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkzODUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"86/100"}],"Metascore":"86","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"2,170","imdbID":"tt8311958","Type":"movie","DVD":"14 Sep 2021","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"9e9a3dbc-bc89-4dbf-b4c2-1ebda5d87599":{"Title":"Bodies at Rest","Year":"2019","Rated":"N/A","Released":"16 Aug 2019","Runtime":"94 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery","Director":"Renny Harlin","Writer":"David Lesser","Actors":"Nick Cheung, Richie Jen, Zi Yang","Plot":"A cat-and-mouse game unfolds over a single night when three armed criminals barge into a morgue, demanding the forensic doctor and his assistant to hand over a bullet lodged inside a corpse.

When Bee (Yew) returns to Malaysia for the first time in a decade - she introduces her conservative father Uncle Chuan (Lee) to her happy-go-lucky British fiancé, Benji (Pfeiffer). With Benji's lack of cultural understanding and comprehension of Chinese traditions, Chuan opposes their marriage. Unexpected circumstances ensue, and Chuan reluctantly submits to their union, on the condition that their wedding adheres to Chinese tradition.

Those changes include manufacturing a new product of her design; what she chooses this time around being a self-wringing mop. That support also includes being able to pitch the idea to Rudy's current wealthy girlfriend, Trudy. Even if she does get to the manufacturing stage, Joy will have to battle the narrow minds of business executives in marketing her product, that is unless she can find a way to get into the homes of the American public in one fell swoop. But nothing is a done deal until the consumer forks out his/her hard earned money for the product and all the legal issues are dealt with. Joy has to decide if she will \"pick up the gun\" as Trudy asked in their initial investment meeting in dealing with an especially troublesome legal issue.","Language":"English, Spanish, French","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 8 wins & 23 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRiOWZmMzUtZTJiOC00MjQ1LTkwMjgtNzhlYzBmODAzYTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"60%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"56/100"}],"Metascore":"56","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"141,928","imdbID":"tt2446980","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Apr 2016","BoxOffice":"$56,451,232","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"98c62fc8-20b0-4d97-a5a6-8a29ef27bd76":{"Title":"The Pursuit of Happyness","Year":"2006","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"15 Dec 2006","Runtime":"117 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Director":"Gabriele Muccino","Writer":"Steve Conrad","Actors":"Will Smith, Thandiwe Newton, Jaden Smith","Plot":"Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner.

Jimmie has long wanted to reclaim what he sees as his place in San Francisco, which to him means the house he grew up in and which his same named paternal grandfather built in the post-war era in a style indicative to the area a century earlier.

This original piece remarkably captures the loneliness faced by some sufferers of mental illness, as well as the challenges faced by their loved ones.

Abdalla shows plenty of aesthetic invention that has rightly seen him hailed as the leader of the critically acclaimed new independent Egyptian cinema.","Language":"Arabic","Country":"Egypt","Awards":"1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTk0MDk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAyMzI3MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"643","imdbID":"tt3394564","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"98e930b7-61f6-4e57-b333-7f7b6d1b8752":{"Title":"Factory Girl","Year":"2013","Rated":"N/A","Released":"19 Mar 2014","Runtime":"90 min","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Director":"Mohamed Khan","Writer":"Wessam Soliman","Actors":"Yasmin Raeis, Hany Adel, Salwa Khattab","Plot":"Hayam is a factory worker who is living in a low middle class area, along with other factory girls.

A standard question Mahmoud is asked in a job interview, only to open up deeper questions within him about his life's purpose. A former manual worker in a printing press whose job has become obsolete due to the growing use of computers, Mahmoud is at point in his life where he begins to relate to the extinction of dinosaurs. He leads a routine life that revolves around the photocopy shop he owns, his pension, always late, and his neighbors and customers who, like him, are warm and affectionate. Nothing clouds this pretty picture except for the greedy landlord, who harbours no compassion for Mahmoud's financial difficulties, and is constantly nagging him about his late rent. Meanwhile, Mahmoud grapples with developing feelings for his neighbor, Safeya, a widow, who in turn grapples with loneliness. Their budding romance hits many roadblocks, from their advancing years, to Safeya's son's disapproval of the relationship, to Safeya's own troubled feelings towards her femininity after undergoing a mastectomy. We enter the world of these lonely characters, as they approach extinction. And with them, we come to realize that one cannot face the dangers of extinction alone; but only through binding with fellow humans in the face of this metaphorical ice age that threatens to wipe out our humanity, even if humans remain.","Language":"Arabic","Country":"Egypt","Awards":"10 wins & 1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVhNzkwYjAtNzMyYi00MzllLTg2YjctMjA1ZWMxYzE3MDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"1,435","imdbID":"tt7464158","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"41bbe30a-cf01-4a50-a37d-6b50085708bd":{"Title":"Sheikh Jackson","Year":"2017","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"04 Oct 2017","Runtime":"93 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Amr Salama","Writer":"Amr Salama, Omar Khaled","Actors":"Ahmad El-Fishawi, Maged El-Kidwani, Ahmed Malek","Plot":"On the 25th of June 2009, the news of Michael Jackson's death took the world by storm affecting many people, especially an Islamic cleric whose nickname was \"Jackson\" during his school days.

He performs his duties with great zeal, and yet he is unduly dismissed. His ego is badly hurt. His experience with clandestine work makes him realize a simple fact - the system of the political police is flawed by nature. Secrecy is both, its power and weakness. The system depends on the presumed authenticity of the agents and recruitment of informants based on fear. The operations of the secret police could be imitated by rogue individuals posing as agents. Batko creates a phantom secret-police department - a back door in the matrix of political control. He becomes the spider in his own web of informants by recruiting a group of intellectuals to spy on each other. He builds his own secret archive. After the fall of communism, Batko uses it to wreak havoc on the government. This is a dark political comedy. A self-styled secret agent engineers a fake political institution that replicates and mocks the omnipotent system of the secret police. A bold political con is launched by a seemingly ridiculous man. His creation becomes a Trojan horse in the apparatus of fear, causing general chaos and making the system look like one stupendous absurdity. The movie offers a paradoxical twist in the standard representation of totalitarianism as a society of victims and victimizers. This is a story without innocents. It exposes the maniacal desire to collaborate and the pleasure of spying on others, the temptation to conform and at the same time hack the system using its own devices. Secret policing reveals its dark nature not only in its nauseating cruelties, but most suggestively in its deviant pleasures.","Language":"Bulgarian","Country":"Bulgaria","Awards":"11 wins & 9 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNiNjQxNDAtZGQ3YS00YmY2LTllZDktMWQzZWNhN2I1ZjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk1NzE0MTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"442","imdbID":"tt2311822","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"bc86fc40-31d0-4954-9017-caf5a7f1829a":{"Title":"Bubblegum","Year":"2017","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"08 Dec 2017","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Stanislav Todorov Rogi","Writer":"Teo Chepilov, Georgi Ivanov, Nevena Kertova","Actors":"Teodora Duhovnikova, Diana Dimitrova, Valentin Ganev","Plot":"Kalin (35) is a talented advertising specialist, weary of life.

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 3 Oscars. 98 wins & 144 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA5NDZlZGUtMjAxOS00YTRkLTkwYmMtYWQ0NWEwZDZiNjEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"89/100"}],"Metascore":"89","imdbRating":"8.5","imdbVotes":"929,833","imdbID":"tt2582802","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Sep 2016","BoxOffice":"$13,092,000","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"13e8551d-7d79-479f-b828-ffd2445572c3":{"Title":"The Grand Budapest Hotel","Year":"2014","Rated":"R","Released":"28 Mar 2014","Runtime":"99 min","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime","Director":"Wes Anderson","Writer":"Stefan Zweig, Wes Anderson, Hugo Guinness","Actors":"Ralph Fiennes, F.

In her focus on her own career especially with high maintenance Ms. Hampton, Lauren has never noticed Ned's dissatisfaction with his job. Within Ned's desire not to have a long engagement, Lauren wants to get married in ten days in her hometown of Darwin as she is able to negotiate the time off with Ms. Hampton. Upon Lauren and Ned's arrival in Darwin, they discover that six months ago her aborigine mother, Daffy Ford, left her father, Trevor Ford, for undisclosed reasons, her whereabouts unknown. With what little information they have on hand, Lauren and Ned leave teary-eyed Trevor in Darwin to lead the wedding planning as they try to find Daffy, Ned funneling his newfound energies into this task, those energies needed as Lauren, who really wants her mother at her wedding, is the one more apt to give up as they seemingly are going on a wild goose chase. As they trek through the expanses of Northern Australia, the leads point them in the direction of the Tiwi Islands, Daffy's homeland where she ran away from at age eighteen on what was to be her own wedding day to escape the arranged marriage - something she only ever talked about in veiled terms to Lauren - never to have returned. With this new information in the context of their situation, Lauren and Ned can't help but reflect on their own relationship in the count down to their own supposed wedding day.","Language":"English, Aboriginal, French","Country":"Australia","Awards":"1 win & 7 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU0NDk0N2EtNTliZS00MjNmLTk0M2MtYTMzOTUxMGQwZWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzE0MTQ2NzQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"2,274","imdbID":"tt7555072","Type":"movie","DVD":"21 Jan 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"23e24a13-ad81-440f-8063-f4a7366c9b98":{"Title":"Palm Beach","Year":"2019","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"17 Mar 2020","Runtime":"100 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Rachel Ward","Writer":"Joanna Murray-Smith, Rachel Ward","Actors":"Frances Berry, Bryan Brown, Matilda Brown","Plot":"Lifelong friends reunite for a party at Sydney's Palm Beach.","Language":"English","Country":"Australia","Awards":"1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEyMmE4YjAtYTNkYi00N2Y4LWFjMjYtMTYwOTk1MTVhZjQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"48%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"1,160","imdbID":"tt8751928","Type":"movie","DVD":"15 Mar 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"699cfc7a-ffef-4396-9bd7-813d69f3aeca":{"Title":"Judy & Punch","Year":"2019","Rated":"N/A","Released":"05 Jun 2020","Runtime":"105 min","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Director":"Mirrah Foulkes","Writer":"Mirrah Foulkes, Tom Punch, Lucy Punch","Actors":"Daisy Axon, Don Bridges, Michael Papas","Plot":"Seaside (nowhere near the sea), puppeteers Judy and Punch are trying to resurrect their marionette show on the brink of an anarchic mob rule.

While Mitzi has always gotten along with her father, the same cannot be said about her mother, an angry, bitter woman. The one person who has always been able to have a calming affect on Annabelle is Mitzi's cousin, Charlie Bearclaw - everyone calling him Charlie B. in homage to all his idols with a surname that begins with the letter such as Baudelaire - a born storyteller who wants to become a teacher, but who spends much time in the hospital with his own chronic health problems.

Coming from communist Cuba, Savon became a symbol of Fidel Castro's politically defiant might. Over 12 years and three Olympic games Savon reportedly turned down an estimated 37 million dollars to leave the amateur ranks and follow in the footsteps of fellow countryman Joel Casamayor. The question is, why would Felix Savon turn down fame and fortune for doing what he clearly proved he was the best at? This is the question at the root of this story and perhaps many of the now slanderous rumors saturating Cuba about Savon's reasoning, was it loyalty, fear, or something else entirely? Having cultivated a close relationship with Cuba's popular leader Fidel Castro, perhaps Savon's loyalty would not allow him to betray his friend and President. Now nearly 20 years have past since his last Olympic championship and Savon is ready to set the record straight as he deals with tumultuous rumors of abuse, as well as economic hardships. Now as he is second guessing his decision to stay in Cuba, the great Felix Savon will answer the 37 million dollar question by showing us the country he loves through his own eyes. This is the story of Savon.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"Cuba","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VjM2NjYzAtOTc0Yy00MjQwLWExN2ItY2E2ZGI0MjEwMDVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODYxNzUzNjc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"N/A","imdbID":"tt9647410","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"ff47487e-41de-4fe2-a9c2-aa59deae3699":{"Title":"Shiva Baby","Year":"2020","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"02 Apr 2021","Runtime":"77 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Emma Seligman","Writer":"Emma Seligman","Actors":"Rachel Sennott, Danny Deferrari, Fred Melamed","Plot":"At a Jewish funeral service with her parents, a college student runs into her sugar daddy and ex girlfriend.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"11 wins & 44 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Y5ZDg1MmMtNjJkYS00NmEzLTk0ZjAtMGUxOTIyMDVlNzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY1MTg4Mzc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"79/100"}],"Metascore":"79","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"27,697","imdbID":"tt11317142","Type":"movie","DVD":"02 Apr 2021","BoxOffice":"$200,565","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"5079132d-4903-4576-a45d-f0112bc222ba":{"Title":"Beans","Year":"2020","Rated":"N/A","Released":"05 Nov 2021","Runtime":"92 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Tracey Deer","Writer":"Tracey Deer, Meredith Vuchnich","Actors":"Kiawentiio, Rainbow Dickerson, Violah Beauvais","Plot":"Based on true events, Tracey Deer's debut feature chronicles the 78-day standoff between two Mohawk communities and government forces in 1990 Quebec.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada","Awards":"15 wins & 13 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUwMDdmNTktZmJlNS00NWY2LWJjYWUtYTZiZjBjZWQ3YmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI4NDMxNzYz._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"942","imdbID":"tt11735544","Type":"movie","DVD":"05 Nov 2021","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"d2b63612-77da-4de3-bb9d-9e24e3409c48":{"Title":"Violation","Year":"2020","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"25 Mar 2021","Runtime":"107 min","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Director":"Dusty Mancinelli, Madeleine Sims-Fewer","Writer":"Dusty Mancinelli, Madeleine Sims-Fewer","Actors":"Madeleine Sims-Fewer, Anna Maguire, Jesse LaVercombe","Plot":"A troubled woman on the edge of divorce returns home to her younger sister after years apart.

In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in the future.","Language":"English","Country":"Poland, United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, Netherlands","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 23 wins & 54 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjE2NjgwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYzMzEwMzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"62/100"}],"Metascore":"62","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"61,336","imdbID":"tt3262342","Type":"movie","DVD":"16 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$6,735,118","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"97d10b22-af74-46a0-a1aa-bd00fbee94ea":{"Title":"Demon","Year":"2015","Rated":"R","Released":"09 Sep 2016","Runtime":"94 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Director":"Marcin Wrona","Writer":"Pawel Maslona, Marcin Wrona","Actors":"Itay Tiran, Agnieszka Zulewska, Andrzej Grabowski","Plot":"A bridegroom is possessed by an unquiet spirit in the midst of his own wedding celebration, in this clever take on the Jewish legend of the dybbuk.","Language":"Polish, English, Yiddish, Russian","Country":"Poland, Israel","Awards":"2 wins & 7 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0ODgwMjA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0ODM2OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"80/100"}],"Metascore":"80","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"5,961","imdbID":"tt4935158","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Dec 2016","BoxOffice":"$104,038","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"1772c04b-9d85-4379-a429-0b7c59720b02":{"Title":"Yuma","Year":"2012","Rated":"N/A","Released":"10 Aug 2012","Runtime":"113 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Director":"Piotr Mularuk","Writer":"Wojciech Gajewicz, Piotr Mularuk","Actors":"Jakub Gierszal, Krzysztof Skonieczny, Jakub Kamienski","Plot":"YUMA is a gripping drama about the rise and fall of Zyga - a Polish kid in his early twenties, who wants to take charge of his life after the fall of communism, but in a time of chaos and moral anarchy, unwillingly becomes a gangster.

The move is in response to Connex losing a number of oil fields in the Persian Gulf region as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, his country's foreign minister, and the oldest son of the Emir and thus the heir apparent to the throne, signed a contract with the Chinese instead. As Killen somehow managed to get the contract for the oil fields in Kazahkstan, the merger would give Connex-Killen additional control of the industry in the Middle East. Connex's retained law firm, headed by Dean Whiting, assigns Bennett Holiday to demonstrate to the US Department of Justice that due diligence has been done to allow the merger to proceed i.e. that the merger would not break any antitrust regulations. The US government is unhappy with Prince Nasir's decision to award the contract to the Chinese, and in combination with issues around illegal weapons, the CIA assigns field agent Bob Barnes, who has experience in the Middle East, to assassinate the Prince, whose eventual leadership would further undermine US oil security. Barnes becomes a pawn in the goings-on between the players. Meanwhile, Geneva based Bryan Woodman, an energy analyst, eventually becomes associated with the Emir and his family, largely due to a tragic incident. In the process, Woodman learns of Prince Nasir's western leanings and his want to change radically his country into a western democracy with a diversified economy. If the Emir found out, it could threaten Prince Nasir ascension to the throne and thus derail the democratization process. Through all these manoeuvrings, migrant workers are affected, some who cannot retain work with the changing of companies controlling the oil. Some of those may try to take matters into their own hands for their form of justice.","Language":"English, Urdu, Arabic, Persian, French, Mandarin","Country":"United States, United Arab Emirates","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 13 wins & 30 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZmQ4MDgtYzZlOC00ZmI0LThmZDMtMzBhNTVmZDE3ODc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"73%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"76/100"}],"Metascore":"76","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"133,055","imdbID":"tt0365737","Type":"movie","DVD":"01 Feb 2009","BoxOffice":"$50,824,620","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"d42cb599-899a-40ff-92f6-72d129efc6e0":{"Title":"From A to B","Year":"2014","Rated":"N/A","Released":"08 Jan 2015","Runtime":"108 min","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Director":"Ali F.

It was just last year that K. Rajagopal's 'A Yellow Bird' dwelt on similar themes, and slightly more than a decade ago that Jack Neo had done likewise with 'One More Chance', but 'Take 2' is intended less as a serious drama on new beginnings and second chances than as a light-hearted dramedy with the same subject matter for the Chinese New Year season.Co-written with his 'Ah Boys to Men' director Neo, Ivan Ho (who also makes his directorial debut here) himself struggles to strike the right balance between humour and seriousness, exacerbated by the blatant repetition of casting a cross-dressing Dennis Chew in a variety of bit roles. There is Dennis Chew as an egotistical 'auntie' whose car Panther had leased for use as a private taxi; there is Dennis Chew as the owner of a tuition centre who offers Jian Ren a teaching position without knowing of his past conviction; there is Dennis Chew as the female boss of a 'bak chor mee' stall whose quarrel with Mad Dog goes viral; and there is Dennis Chew as a beggar who bursts into church with face shrouded in shadow looking like Jesus Christ. As much as Chew doesn't attempt to steal the limelight in each one of these scenes, his presence alone ultimately distracts from the intended message of the stigmatization that these ex-cons face while trying to get back on their feet, even at times trivializing their very predicaments.Among the quartet, only Tiger emerges as a fully enough formed character that we come to empathise with, especially as he tries in vain to get through to his estranged teenage son Guang (newcomer Shawn Ho) who appears to be following in his younger day's footsteps. Whereas, Panther and Mad Dog's presence seem to go not much further than as comic sidekicks, and Jian Ren is (well) almost completely sidelined. It should also come as no surprise that, among them, Lian's performance is easily the most gripping, injecting some much-needed gravitas into a film that would otherwise come off too lightweight for its own good. Graduating from his scene-stealing supporting part in Neo's epic period drama 'Long Long Time Ago' into the lead role here, Lian also holds his own against veteran actor Chen Tianwen, who sheds his 'Mr Unbelievable' persona for a truly menacing villainous part named Di Tie with his own score to settle with Tiger.Oh yes, as formula would have it, Di Tie represents the past that comes back to haunt our four flawed heroes just as they are about to make a breakthrough with a new business venture that combines Tiger's cooking talent with Jian Ren's excellent Maths teaching skills and Panther's entrepreneurial instincts. Bearing the film's titular name, the three-in-one establishment offers tuition services for kids with food and beverage options and massage services for their waiting parents. And yet, that promising restart threatens to be derailed by Di Tie, who not only exploits Mad Dog (who owes him money he borrowed to feed his gambling habit) to spike the establishment's water on its opening day but also Guang to frame his father for drug possession, thus culminating in a showdown at a warehouse pier that you've probably seen the trailers teased.Whereas the earlier two acts alternated between comedy and drama, the last adds action into the mix – what with Mad Dog dusting off his former 'choppers' inscribed with his former nickname 'Geylang Mad Dog' (prompting one of the genuinely funny quips from Blackie that he had ORD-ed from gangster-hood without 'returning his arms') and Panther packing a fire extinguisher, a washing basin, a pair of nanchucks and rope to stage an ambush on MRT and his gang. The ensuing mishmash is as discordant as it sounds, vacillating between melodramatic scenes of Tiger fending off MRT's brutal attack for the sake of Guang and amusing scenes of nerdy Jian Ren transforming into a 'nanchucks' expert as well as Panther channeling his inner Bruce Lee. And yet, there is undeniably a scrappy charm to the proceedings, driven by the chemistry between Lian, Wang and Chen that translates into a palpable sense of brotherhood between their characters on screen.That 'Take 2' proves to be somewhat rough around the edges is perhaps to be expected, given how this is only Ho's maiden outing behind the camera. His background as a writer no doubt makes his debut feature a lot more narratively coherent than some of Neo's earlier works, but as a director, Ho seems to have adopted his mentor's sitcom-ish style despite trying to infuse a more urbane flair with the use of Latin tunes like Gabriel Saientz's 'Te Quiero'. As far as inspiring its audience to give ex-cons in society a 'take two', 'Take 2' isn't nearly as moving or poignant as it needs to be; but as comedy fare for the Chinese New Year season, there is enough humour, wit and even sheer nuttiness to keep you engaged, if not entertained. Just as how it is not realistic for ex- cons to keep their old ways while starting over, 'Take 2' cannot be both goofy and compelling at the same time, so it is no surprise that it ultimately comes off more of the former and much less of the latter.","Language":"Mandarin","Country":"Singapore","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY1MmRkZTEtYmUzMi00N2UyLWIyNmItYWZiMGE0M2EyZTMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY3MTkzOTI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"35","imdbID":"tt6441310","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"4f41f62f-8135-4368-a3ab-8356fe10e62f":{"Title":"Recipe","Year":"2013","Rated":"N/A","Released":"29 Sep 2013","Runtime":"46 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Eric Khoo","Writer":"Kim Hoh Wong","Actors":"Zoe Tay, Yinzhu Li, Jayley Woo","Plot":"N/A","Language":"Mandarin","Country":"Singapore","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNmMTYyZDEtYTdiMi00NzhlLTgxYzctYzQ5NGM3YjdiMzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0OTAwNjA1._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"N/A","imdbID":"tt3764266","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}}
