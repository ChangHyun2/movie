In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in the future.","Language":"English","Country":"Poland, United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, Netherlands","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 23 wins & 54 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjE2NjgwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYzMzEwMzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"62/100"}],"Metascore":"62","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"61,336","imdbID":"tt3262342","Type":"movie","DVD":"16 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$6,735,118","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"6eb1815d-d78c-404a-94c5-a2d39870b3b3":{"Title":"Soof","Year":"2013","Rated":"N/A","Released":"12 Dec 2013","Runtime":"96 min","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Director":"Antoinette Beumer","Writer":"Marjolein Beumer, Sylvia Witteman","Actors":"Lies Visschedijk, Fedja van Huêt, Daniel Karaty","Plot":"Soof is reaching 40 and has everything she ever wanted: three children, a small catering business, a sweet husband Kasper, and a lovely home.

Every day, he has to go out in the street with his cohort of security guards who speak a bewildering array of accents from all over China, and track down and arrest thieves, hucksters, and con artists. And he's good at it; after more than 10 years on the force, Zhang Hui Ling has an uncanny ability to sniff out criminals from the throngs of people passing through his district. He needs those skills in Shuangyushu, a migrant neighborhood where criminals congregate. Like the car thief who steal BMW's and Mercedes with interface gadgets he buys on the Internet, or the family gang who crash cars into passing automobiles and demand settlement on the spot, or the currency counterfeiters, con artists who dress as monks to defraud religious old women in crisis, or the former thief who was injured during his last arrest and now hounds his unemployed younger brother for cash, or the retired master thief who is looking for a way to reclaim his former glory. These thieves, con artists, and criminals, and the bottomless pain and bitterness buried in their hearts, are the underworld in this society. And these people, criminals of every sort, are the type of people Zhang Hui Ling has to deal with every day. There's no outlet for the humiliation and misery he endures as part of it. His job is to face it and deal with it, to stop crimes from happening. But he can't help feeling like it's partly his fault that he's failing, somehow, because the crime and misery doesn't stop. In the depths of his spirit, the positive and negative forces in his life grapple, every day, every crime, every arrest, every bit of mercy and understanding renewing the endless battle for his soul.","Language":"Mandarin","Country":"China","Awards":"7 wins & 14 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUzNDhmYzMtOTllYS00OWNmLTkyZGYtMjUwNDhmNTE5NWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ2MTk1OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"297","imdbID":"tt2273470","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"335e70f9-dc32-48f4-85ae-3b07c9f00a31":{"Title":"The Great Wall","Year":"2016","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"17 Feb 2017","Runtime":"103 min","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Director":"Yimou Zhang","Writer":"Carlo Bernard, Doug Miro, Tony Gilroy","Actors":"Matt Damon, Tian Jing, Willem Dafoe","Plot":"When a mercenary warrior (Matt Damon) is imprisoned within the Great Wall, he discovers the mystery behind one of the greatest wonders of the world.

Since her son Rocco (Rafael Santana) is born, Nuri is no longer working as a drug dealer, because he studied business administration in prison and now runs a translation and tax office in Hamburg. One day Rocco and Nuri are killed by a nail bomb that was deposited in front of the office. This has shredded everything. Because her husband was in prison for drug possession, the police investigated in the red-light district. The investigators do not see that the tracks point in a completely different direction. Then they happen to be the real killers on the net. The main suspects are neo-Nazi spouses André (Ulrich Brandhoff) and Edda Möller (Hanna Hilsdorf). But the trial is developing differently than Katja had hoped. Although her lawyer Danilo (Denis Moschitto) speaks of a watertight evidence, defender Haberbeck (Johannes Krisch) manages to settle the case in favor of the defendants. Humiliated and destroyed by the trial, Katja sees no reason to continue living. If she wants to restore meaning to her life, she has to take the law into her own hands.","Language":"German, Greek, English, Turkish","Country":"Germany, France","Awards":"17 wins & 25 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc2NTkyZjEtMTYxNC00YTJmLTgzZjMtNTVmOTZmNDBhMjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAzODU1NDQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"76%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"34,730","imdbID":"tt5723272","Type":"movie","DVD":"31 Mar 2018","BoxOffice":"$321,011","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"1b783c63-2576-41c8-b81a-4702d60013b3":{"Title":"Western","Year":"2017","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"24 Aug 2017","Runtime":"121 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Valeska Grisebach","Writer":"Valeska Grisebach","Actors":"Meinhard Neumann, Reinhardt Wetrek, Syuleyman Alilov Letifov","Plot":"A group of German construction workers start a tough job at a remote site in the Bulgarian countryside.

During her absence from work, her boss, M. Dumont, on the suggestion of her immediate supervisor, the shop foreman Jean-Marc, figures that her section of the company can function with sixteen people working full time with a bit of overtime instead of seventeen with no overtime, that seventeenth person being Sandra. Because of the global competition the company faces, Dumont decides the company can only finance the annual bonuses for those sixteen employees, which are EUR1,000 per person, or Sandra's job, leaving the decision to those sixteen. On a Friday near the end of her medical leave, Sandra learns of this situation from her friend and co-worker Juliette after the \"show of hands\" vote is held, the result a 13-3 decision for the bonuses over Sandra's job. Because Juliette knows Jean-Marc, who is determined to get rid of Sandra, influenced the vote by scare mongering through misinformation, Juliette and Sandra, at the end of the working day on Friday, are able to convince Dumont to hold another secret ballot on Monday morning, with Sandra needing a majority to keep her job, meaning nine votes. By Saturday morning, Sandra's supportive husband, Manu, convinces her that over the weekend she should speak to each and all of the thirteen who voted for the bonuses to get them to change their minds.

The city of Brussels, plagued by high rates of youth unemployment, is home to nearly forty street gangs, and the number of young people drawn into the city's gang culture increases each year. It's in this criminal milieu that directing duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah set Black, a pulse-pounding contemporary take on a Shakespearean tragedy. Worlds collide when Mavela (Martha Canga Antonio), a teenage girl with ties to Brussels' Black Bronx gang, meets Marwan (Aboubakr Bensaihi), a member of a rival Moroccan gang, at a police station. Keenly aware of the consequences of getting involved with someone from another gang, they at first resist their attraction to one another, but they can only resist for so long. Just when they've started to imagine a different life for themselves, a terrifying incident reminds Mavela where she belongs - and, more precisely, to whom. In order to break free, Mavela and Marwan will have to betray the very loyalties on which their gangs are founded. And they know what lies ahead for them if they don't. El Arbi and Fallah's film moves forward at an electrifying pace, with furious energy and a gritty realism reminiscent of epic gangster films like City of God and Goodfellas. Ricocheting from moments of extreme tenderness to scenes of extreme violence, and enhanced by the raw performances of its young leads, Black is a full-on, no-holds-barred experience that will resonate long after you've left the cinema.","Language":"French, Dutch, Arabic, Lingala","Country":"Belgium","Awards":"12 wins & 12 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0OTIwMjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk0ODUzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"60%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"4,506","imdbID":"tt4008758","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b64f7082-9c97-4517-865d-fe6235085f60":{"Title":"Lost River","Year":"2014","Rated":"R","Released":"10 Apr 2015","Runtime":"95 min","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Mystery","Director":"Ryan Gosling","Writer":"Ryan Gosling","Actors":"Christina Hendricks, Iain De Caestecker, Matt Smith","Plot":"This movie is a dark fairy tale about love, family, and the fight for survival in the face of danger.

Child's Pose is based on the sense of loss of parents who have to send their children away-physically and psychologically. The parent-child relationship is re-assessed through a son in his 30s that wants to escape from his mother, who in turn wants to keep her adult son by her side. The mother's character is quite familiar, but this film is unique in that the director delicately portrays how the controlling mother wants to deny that her son is destined to leave her by following the characters' emotional flows and gazing at their twisted desires. Luminita Gheorghiu turns in an extraordinary performance in playing a mother struggling to \"save\" her son. Heading to the conclusion, the film shows that the unhealthy mother-son relationship is not that simple when it comes to matters of humane duty.","Language":"Romanian","Country":"Romania","Awards":"13 wins & 8 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzIwNzEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzNzI5MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"77/100"}],"Metascore":"77","imdbRating":"7.4","imdbVotes":"8,706","imdbID":"tt2187115","Type":"movie","DVD":"10 Aug 2016","BoxOffice":"$97,170","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"4aa15412-950b-49d9-98e9-b604dd372ff1":{"Title":"California Dreamin'","Year":"2007","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"23 Jan 2009","Runtime":"155 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, War","Director":"Cristian Nemescu","Writer":"Catherine Linstrum, Cristian Nemescu, Tudor Voican","Actors":"Armand Assante, Jamie Elman, Razvan Vasilescu","Plot":"In 1999, during the Kosovo War,a train carrying NATO equipment, escorted by American Marines with Captain Doug Jones in command, is held back in Capalnita, a Romanian godforsaken village, by Doiaru, the station master, who blocks the train over a paperwork technicality.

He performs his duties with great zeal, and yet he is unduly dismissed. His ego is badly hurt. His experience with clandestine work makes him realize a simple fact - the system of the political police is flawed by nature. Secrecy is both, its power and weakness. The system depends on the presumed authenticity of the agents and recruitment of informants based on fear. The operations of the secret police could be imitated by rogue individuals posing as agents. Batko creates a phantom secret-police department - a back door in the matrix of political control. He becomes the spider in his own web of informants by recruiting a group of intellectuals to spy on each other. He builds his own secret archive. After the fall of communism, Batko uses it to wreak havoc on the government. This is a dark political comedy. A self-styled secret agent engineers a fake political institution that replicates and mocks the omnipotent system of the secret police. A bold political con is launched by a seemingly ridiculous man. His creation becomes a Trojan horse in the apparatus of fear, causing general chaos and making the system look like one stupendous absurdity. The movie offers a paradoxical twist in the standard representation of totalitarianism as a society of victims and victimizers. This is a story without innocents. It exposes the maniacal desire to collaborate and the pleasure of spying on others, the temptation to conform and at the same time hack the system using its own devices. Secret policing reveals its dark nature not only in its nauseating cruelties, but most suggestively in its deviant pleasures.","Language":"Bulgarian","Country":"Bulgaria","Awards":"11 wins & 9 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNiNjQxNDAtZGQ3YS00YmY2LTllZDktMWQzZWNhN2I1ZjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk1NzE0MTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"441","imdbID":"tt2311822","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"1e08bd87-25b0-4a1e-a01e-f9e50ca39e36":{"Title":"The Professor","Year":"2018","Rated":"R","Released":"17 May 2019","Runtime":"90 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Wayne Roberts","Writer":"Wayne Roberts","Actors":"Johnny Depp, Rosemarie DeWitt, Odessa Young","Plot":"After learning about his terminal diagnosis, a college professor decides to live his life to the fullest by drinking, smoking and expressing real thoughts for the people around him.

A former manual worker in a printing press whose job has become obsolete due to the growing use of computers, Mahmoud is at point in his life where he begins to relate to the extinction of dinosaurs. He leads a routine life that revolves around the photocopy shop he owns, his pension, always late, and his neighbors and customers who, like him, are warm and affectionate. Nothing clouds this pretty picture except for the greedy landlord, who harbours no compassion for Mahmoud's financial difficulties, and is constantly nagging him about his late rent. Meanwhile, Mahmoud grapples with developing feelings for his neighbor, Safeya, a widow, who in turn grapples with loneliness. Their budding romance hits many roadblocks, from their advancing years, to Safeya's son's disapproval of the relationship, to Safeya's own troubled feelings towards her femininity after undergoing a mastectomy. We enter the world of these lonely characters, as they approach extinction. And with them, we come to realize that one cannot face the dangers of extinction alone; but only through binding with fellow humans in the face of this metaphorical ice age that threatens to wipe out our humanity, even if humans remain.","Language":"Arabic","Country":"Egypt","Awards":"10 wins & 1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVhNzkwYjAtNzMyYi00MzllLTg2YjctMjA1ZWMxYzE3MDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"1,435","imdbID":"tt7464158","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"d28d6726-ea46-4278-9f44-c5db570cac5a":{"Title":"Vacation","Year":"2015","Rated":"R","Released":"29 Jul 2015","Runtime":"99 min","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Director":"John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein","Writer":"Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, John Hughes","Actors":"Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo","Plot":"Following in the footsteps of his father, Clark Griswold, the man with a vision in National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), his son, too, the hard-working family man, Rusty Griswold, wants to have some quality time with his wife, Debbie, and their two sons, Kevin and James.

The monks belatedly realize that in this wild land of ancient superstitions, the faith that binds them together may ultimately lead to their destruction.","Language":"English, Irish Gaelic, French, Latin","Country":"Ireland, Belgium","Awards":"1 win & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk4MjU3MzktOWUxMC00MTA4LTgzYmMtYzBiODQ1ZjI0NjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"68%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"60/100"}],"Metascore":"60","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"6,213","imdbID":"tt3531202","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 Aug 2017","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"046b0fec-e6bc-4893-895c-e9b7a52bb44d":{"Title":"Jimmy's Hall","Year":"2014","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"30 May 2014","Runtime":"109 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Director":"Ken Loach","Writer":"Paul Laverty, Donal O'Kelly","Actors":"Barry Ward, Francis Magee, Aileen Henry","Plot":"1932. Jimmy Gralton is back home in the Irish countryside after ten years of forced exile in the USA. His widowed mother Alice is happy, Jimmy's friends are happy, all the young people who enjoy dancing and singing are happy. Which is not the case of Father Sheridan, the local priest, nor of the village squire, nor of Dennis O'Keefe, the chief of the fascists. The reason is simple: Jimmy is a socialist activist. So when the \"intruder\" reopens the village hall, thus enabling the villagers to gather to sing, dance, paint, study or box, they take a dim view of the whole thing. People who think and unite are difficult to manipulate, aren't they?

Like Burnham did more than a decade ago, 13-year-old Kayla turns to YouTube to express herself, where she makes advice blogs in which she pretends to have it all together. In reality, Kayla is sullen and silent around her single father and her peers at school, carrying out most of her interactions with her classmates on Instagram and Twitter. Her YouTube videos are a clever narrative tool that provide insight into her inner hopes and dreams, much like an inspirational online diary.

The parents have passed their socialist and survivalist ideals to their children. Ben considers most of Western society to be fascist, especially corporate America. He also believes that no one will or should be there for you, so you'd better learn how to take care of yourself. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training; know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains, and even fractures; and know how to hunt, forage, and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however, within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie's health. Formerly an attorney, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben believes that this disorder started with her postpartum depression with Bo. Yet Leslie's condition has worsened. Despite not believing in Western medicine, Ben sends Leslie to a hospital close to Ben's sister, Harper, so that there can be family close by. While hospitalized, Leslie commits suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie's act brings out a battle between Ben and Leslie's father, Jack Bertrang, a Christian who not only blames Ben for Leslie's death, but believes that what he is doing \"to\" the children can legally be considered abuse. Jack takes over the funeral arrangements as per his and his complacent wife Abby's Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie's wishes, as she believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, Ben and the children believe it is their mission to honor Leslie's last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophy. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long dormant issues between the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","Language":"English, Esperanto, German, Chinese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 15 wins & 51 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTM0OTY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcxOTQ3ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"83%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"228,364","imdbID":"tt3553976","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 Oct 2016","BoxOffice":"$5,879,835","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"0f8cba0b-c41e-4d36-bd45-780f45527ea2":{"Title":"Inside Llewyn Davis","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"10 Jan 2014","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Drama, Music","Director":"Ethan Coen, Joel Coen","Writer":"Joel Coen, Ethan Coen","Actors":"Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, John Goodman","Plot":"Follow a week in the life of a young folk singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.

His extended family - namely he and his many cousins - own 25,000 acres of undeveloped land on Kauai held in trust, which ends in seven years. The easiest thing for the family to do is sell the land before the seven years is up, which is all the talk in the state, as, to whom they sell the property could very well change the face of Kauai. Despite the vast wealth that comes with the land, Matt has decided to live solely on what he earns as a Honolulu lawyer. However, Matt has not had a perfect life living in Hawaiian paradise as many believe. He and his wife Elizabeth were having problems in their marriage. She recently got into a boating accident which has placed her in a coma. Their seventeen year old daughter Alex is in boarding school on the big island since they couldn't handle her rebellion, which was made all the worse by an argument of an unknown nature between mother and daughter during Alex's last visit home.

Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","Language":"English, Spanish, Portuguese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 132 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg4ZmY1MmItMjFjOS00ZTg2LWJjNDYtNDM2YmM2NzhiNmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzMTY4MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"92/100"}],"Metascore":"92","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"122,380","imdbID":"tt5649144","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$5,904,366","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"7f4a2169-6cab-4d69-9b63-720199cdb233":{"Title":"Tiger Theory","Year":"2016","Rated":"N/A","Released":"31 Mar 2016","Runtime":"107 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Radek Bajgar","Writer":"Radek Bajgar, Mirka Zlatníková","Actors":"Jirí Bartoska, Eliska Balzerová, Tatiana Dyková","Plot":"The last drop for Jan's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, whose strength and patience ran dry.

That all changed in June, 2011 when he was forced to resign in disgrace after admitting that he did tweet lewd \"headless\" photos of himself from his public Twitter account to women he met online, and that it was not the work of a hacker or that the photos were of someone else. At the time, his wife Huma Abedin, herself a key aide to Hillary Clinton, was pregnant with their first child, she who decided to stand by her man. Two years later with Abedin still by his side, Weiner tries to resurrect his political career in a run for New York City mayor. He realizes that he has an uphill battle not only because of the known previously tweeted photos, but that there are other lewd photos from that era that may also come to light during the campaign. Regardless of the 2011 resignation, Weiner may not want to admit that any wrongdoing in his personal life should affect his ability to do his job as a politician, congressman, mayor or otherwise. He is probably well aware that the behavior associated with the tweeted photos will dog him during the entire election campaign - with some voters not caring what he does in his personal life, some never willing to forgive or forget such behavior, and some in the middle, those who he has to convince to vote for him. But will the collective \"they\" - including his campaign staff and Abedin - care and forgive a second time around if the behavior has continued, especially if he did or does not own up to it?","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award8 wins & 54 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxODA4NjE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg4MTc3ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"10,418","imdbID":"tt5278596","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Nov 2016","BoxOffice":"$1,676,108","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"7f1c93df-e1c7-4a8e-b1dd-2c5db1c164ff":{"Title":"Mudbound","Year":"2017","Rated":"R","Released":"17 Nov 2017","Runtime":"134 min","Genre":"Drama, War","Director":"Dee Rees","Writer":"Virgil Williams, Dee Rees, Hillary Jordan","Actors":"Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke","Plot":"In the aftermath of WWII, somewhere in the muddy Mississippi Delta, two families--one black, the Jacksons, and the other white, the McAllans--are forced to share the same patch of land, keeping a frail race-based peace with each other.

A cinematographic investigation through the sense of love in our days. The virtues, wonders and novelties of our time. A delicate poetry in which, attending about love, avoid the commonplace, collapsing in a violent adventure between beauty, passion, anger and madness. As the story elapses, the subjectivity of the characters displays as open doors in an intimate and profound examination on their emotions.

Emblematic events connect curiosity, away from a conventional approach of watching a film. There's no hero or villain, at the contrary the director includes a freestyle technique plenty of dance, music, philosophy and art, avoiding the tedious didacticism. A journey through the twists of our hearts beheld in a critical and poetical vision. tantalizing mixture of cinematographic styles. A true pair of wings that releases imagination. To cross at the same time history and thought, there are fun events that fall out of the imagination of the characters. Suddenly, you can see their unconsciousness, representing the contemporary neurosis. Parables and weaknesses lived on the conflict in bonding with someone. Shocks and promises of unconditional love and the search for self-love. The director works the taboos that people deny on the couch of a psychologist. In a strong and virile handling, the film risks bravely by the meanings of feelings. Fear, shame, failure, moral, religion and ideology. Trends that gather the formation of man and his history. Themes not often explored in the last bit of Brazilian films. A different work of art, from the cast through the editing, opposed to nostalgia and homage.

Based on Nguyen Thi Ngoc Tu's best selling short story \"Boundless Rice Field\", winner of the best short story prize from the Vietnam Writer's Association in 2007 and the ASEAN Literature Award recently, Floating Lives will draw audiences into the colourful daily life of unsophisticated peasants scratching out a living in the beautiful but forgiving landscape of the immense, mysterious and prescient Mekong Delta, characters whose strength, flaws and beauty, as they search for the sustenance of life and love, tear at one's heart.","Language":"Vietnamese","Country":"Vietnam","Awards":"3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkzYTE3ODAtMThkMy00ZTk4LWJkZTMtZmY5NWI3NjI3YjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTIxNDQ1MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"374","imdbID":"tt1772864","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"a21a79eb-8f71-43ec-97c7-89c5963ab5e0":{"Title":"The Uninvited: A Red River Rivalry Nightmare","Year":"2012","Rated":"N/A","Released":"01 Oct 2012","Runtime":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Director":"Christopher Farah","Writer":"Blake Bruns","Actors":"Brett Davern, Abigail Klein, Glen Powell","Plot":"N/A","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"N/A","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"8","imdbID":"tt2461014","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"a7f3157c-4819-4a90-8921-2e6911b216fd":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"ecef4044-677a-428a-96f9-2dc9e775cc37":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"7867aa6e-ac79-40ea-bee8-884506c4d179":{"Title":"The Letter","Year":"2012","Rated":"R","Released":"27 Jun 2013","Runtime":"92 min","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Director":"Jay Anania","Writer":"Jay Anania","Actors":"Winona Ryder, Josh Hamilton, Marin Ireland","Plot":"Martine, a playwright, begins to mentally unravel before her upcoming premiere night.

Khoi decides to stay, but while he showers, Dong and Lam - who turn out to be boyfriends - run off with all his cash and belongings. It's not long before Lam is himself abandoned by Dong, and winds up back on the street as a prostitute. Meanwhile the penniless and disillusioned Khoi takes on menial jobs to survive. Lam and Khoi are eventually reunited, and despite Lam's past actions, the two become closer and closer - even though Khoi becomes more and more troubled by Lam's dangerous source of income. At the same time, Cuoi, a mentally handicapped man abandoned by his family, attempts to befriend a female prostitute. Her pimps do not take kindly to his hanging around and scaring away customers, but she takes pity on him and ultimately becomes his protector.","Language":"Vietnamese","Country":"Vietnam","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxMDE3M2QtYmRiYi00NTllLWJjYzItOWM2MjM5NGFjODJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU0NzkwMDg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"733","imdbID":"tt2043880","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"c6c17531-dc45-4739-9b72-ec194c976997":{"Title":"Adrift","Year":"2013","Rated":"N/A","Released":"N/A","Runtime":"5 min","Genre":"Documentary, Short, Adventure","Director":"Simon Christen","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"N/A","Plot":"Adrift is a love letter to the fog of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Thereafter, rumour has it that Hong Kong's three most notorious mobsters, known in the underworld as the \"Three Kings of Thieves\", are plotting together to score a final hit before the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong. However, none are initially aware of the rumour. Yip is living as a fugitive after a gunfight with the Royal Hong Kong Police. He now makes his fortunes by smuggling counterfeit electronics. Powerful and prestigious in the past, Yip must now grovel to high Chinese officials. Although successful in his business, he becomes depressed. When the rumour comes to him, he feels the urge to give up everything and pick up his gun once again to join forces with the others. Kwai is very cautious and uses several pseudonyms to hide his identity. Although the scale of his crimes is nowhere as large as Yip's and Cheuk's, but he has managed to commit repeated robberies that are totally unknown to the police. Small-scale robberies, which have become his expertise, have minimal risk but also little profit. As he hears of the rumour, he realizes that he will make a large fortune by collaborating with Yip and Cheuk. He initially restrains himself and chooses to ignore it. However, Cheuk begins to have second thoughts. Cheuk has recently abducted the son of a rich tycoon and successfully extorted a ransom, all while under police surveillance. Wanting to raise the bar for himself, he hears about the rumour and becomes obsessed with the idea, going to extreme lengths to seek out Yip and Kwai.","Language":"Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai","Country":"Hong Kong, China","Awards":"11 wins & 13 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc3NDMyMmMtYjg1My00NDU5LTkzZmItZmE5OTYzMjE4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI1NTU1Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"2,368","imdbID":"tt4379800","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Apr 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"65889377-ba20-4142-879c-b0b51bde83b2":{"Title":"Operation Mekong","Year":"2016","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"30 Sep 2016","Runtime":"123 min","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Director":"Dante Lam","Writer":"Dante Lam, Kang-Kei Chu, Siu-Kwan Lau","Actors":"Hanyu Zhang, Eddie Peng, Baoguo Chen","Plot":"Two Chinese merchant ships were attacked in Mekong river and 13 crews were killed.

Despite the vast wealth that comes with the land, Matt has decided to live solely on what he earns as a Honolulu lawyer. However, Matt has not had a perfect life living in Hawaiian paradise as many believe. He and his wife Elizabeth were having problems in their marriage. She recently got into a boating accident which has placed her in a coma. Their seventeen year old daughter Alex is in boarding school on the big island since they couldn't handle her rebellion, which was made all the worse by an argument of an unknown nature between mother and daughter during Alex's last visit home. And their ten year old daughter Scottie is starting to act out, which Matt doesn't know if he can handle, potentially raising her on his own. Matt decides to bring Alex home upon news that Elizabeth is brain dead, and that she will be pulled off life support. But revelations about Elizabeth and Alex's argument, which is tied indirectly to the issue of the land sale, leads to some decisions on Matt's part about what is best for him in both mourning Elizabeth's death and what is the best thing to do about the land, the two decisions which may be incompatible.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 148 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTA1MTcyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyODczNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"246,752","imdbID":"tt1033575","Type":"movie","DVD":"25 Nov 2015","BoxOffice":"$82,584,160","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"ebd58c8c-db4e-4142-88fe-cc5c66fdb7ba":{"Title":"Soul Surfer","Year":"2011","Rated":"PG","Released":"08 Apr 2011","Runtime":"112 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Family","Director":"Sean McNamara","Writer":"Sean McNamara, Deborah Schwartz, Douglas Schwartz","Actors":"AnnaSophia Robb, Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt","Plot":"13 year-old Bethany Hamilton is a champion surfer who was born to be in the water.

A decade after that humiliating night, they remain rooted to the bottom of FIFA's World rankings, having scored only twice in seventeen years. They have lost every competitive game they have ever played. Against this backdrop of serial underachievement, the team face the daunting prospect of a qualification campaign for the upcoming 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It would take a miracle-maker or a madman to turn the team's fortunes around - and in maverick Dutch coach Thomas Rongen the islanders somehow find both. As a loan appointment from the mighty U.S. Soccer Federation, with experience of playing alongside football greats like George Best and Johann Cruyff, Rongen is completely unprepared for what greets him on the island - in his own words it is \"by far the lowest standard\" of football he's ever seen, with only half of his team even fit enough to play a whole game. A lack of athleticism aside, Rongen's ailing squad contains the emotionally scarred goalkeeper who conceded 31 goals against Australia a decade earlier and a member of Samoa's third gender, the fa'fafine, who lives 24/7 as a woman. To complicate matters further the team's best player has been posted 6000 miles away by the US military. With the team about to embark on a grueling World Cup Qualification campaign, Rongen has just one month to transform this ragtag of losers into a winning team - and perhaps learn a little about himself along the way.","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"2 wins & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODcxOTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU0NTg1MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"2,774","imdbID":"tt2446600","Type":"movie","DVD":"22 Jul 2014","BoxOffice":"$43,089","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"c18d56f1-aa4d-42a2-ad62-4a19631103e7":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"8dc923f1-eceb-4a13-b9eb-e1a7d796d5b1":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"b6ce1b1f-88e3-4f9e-84a8-134bbb0c392e":{"Title":"Paradise Broken","Year":"2011","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"14 Oct 2011","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Director":"James Sereno","Writer":"Chris McKinney, Chris McKinney","Actors":"Dante Basco, Nadine Nicole, Khalil Kain","Plot":"Ray and Misha's one bedroom apartment, only a half-a-mile from Waikiki Beach, feels a world away from the white sandy beaches and crystal blue waters of Honolulu.

These are the pink sari-clad women of the Gulabi Gang, who use words as weapons - demanding their rights, submitting petitions and haranguing corrupt officials. They travel long distances by cart and tractor, bus and train, to wrest justice for women and dalits, undeterred by sneering policemen and condescending bureaucrats. Sampat Pal, the group's founder, is a rough-and-tough woman with a commanding personality. Despite being born into a traditional family and married off early, she has evolved her own brand of feminism and egalitarian politics. Constantly on the move, today she may be found investigating the suspicious death of a young woman, tomorrow protesting against a corrupt official. The Gulabi Gang, with a membership of thousands, is active across many districts. Suman Singh, one of the leaders, has made it her personal mission to send a land-grabbing village chief behind bars, along with his murderous henchmen. But what's to be done when the brother of a fellow activist carries out an \"honour killing\"? Husna, a longtime member, is forced to choose between family loyalties and all that their fragile movement stands for. The Gang is still very new, and many of its members still steeped in conservative values. A whole village connives in protecting the perpetrators of violence, aided by those in power. Everywhere, the Gang encounters resistance to its notions of gender equality and efforts for social change. The film pulls us into the centre of all these blazing conflicts: we are moved by the women's courage and determination, while their frustrations and disappointments mirror our own. As it travels with them through the dusty and desolate landscape, Gulabi Gang uncovers a complex story, disturbing yet heartening.","Language":"Hindi","Country":"Norway, India, Denmark","Awards":"8 wins & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Njg5MDEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMTc5Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"226","imdbID":"tt2196638","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"74ff366d-922c-4c0d-84fb-0587802a8b7b":{"Title":"Black City Lights: Not Enough (For Us)","Year":"2014","Rated":"N/A","Released":"17 Aug 2014","Runtime":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Music","Director":"Amanda Öman","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Jimmy Roye-Dunne","Plot":"N/A","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhiYTNmNDMtYzc4MC00OGQ0LWI5ZWQtZmVlN2FmMGVmNTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTExNzg5OTI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"N/A","imdbID":"tt4536826","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"77e1336d-0301-481c-b8d2-d4a241c3831c":{"Title":"Mahayoddha Rama","Year":"2016","Rated":"N/A","Released":"04 Nov 2016","Runtime":"106 min","Genre":"Animation","Director":"Rohit Jaising Vaid","Writer":"Javed Akhtar, Varun Grover, Rahul Patel","Actors":"Kunal Kapoor, Jimmy Shergill, Gulshan Grover","Plot":"Mahayoddha Rama retells the great epic of Hindu god, Rama. in this epic, Rama is born to king Dashrath and as an adult fights the 10-headed demon Ravanna.","Language":"Hindi","Country":"India","Awards":"1 win","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxZWU2MWUtZjE3MC00YTU1LTgyY2QtYzU1Yjk4NzIxNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjM4Mjk1MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"48","imdbID":"tt1479690","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"bbf2b893-4534-43d2-a7ee-82d7dc316cc1":null,"5c0ffd8c-5473-4743-89b0-3b3d91c068ec":{"Title":"Bharat","Year":"2019","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"05 Jun 2019","Runtime":"150 min","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Drama","Director":"Ali Abbas Zafar","Writer":"Su-jin Park, Varun V.

His trouble with the law, coupled with an escalating war between a local drug lord, creates a tense standoff: both sides are closing in, and Kunene must stay one step ahead--or his empire, and his life, will come crashing down.","Language":"English, Afrikaans","Country":"South Africa","Awards":"6 wins & 1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTkyMzMzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczNDk0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"77%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"53/100"}],"Metascore":"53","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"10,784","imdbID":"tt0783532","Type":"movie","DVD":"15 Dec 2010","BoxOffice":"$7,294","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"d4c6b91d-6221-4f97-ac8f-9aff87149045":{"Title":"Winnie Mandela","Year":"2011","Rated":"R","Released":"06 Sep 2013","Runtime":"104 min","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Director":"Darrell Roodt","Writer":"Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob, André Pieterse, Darrell Roodt","Actors":"Jennifer Hudson, Terrence Howard, Elias Koteas","Plot":"A drama that chronicles the life of Winnie Mandela from her childhood through her marriage and her husband's incarceration.","Language":"English, Xhosa","Country":"South Africa, Canada","Awards":"3 wins & 7 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMTI4NjM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk0MjIwMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"19%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"37/100"}],"Metascore":"37","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"870","imdbID":"tt1551641","Type":"movie","DVD":"13 Jan 2015","BoxOffice":"$80,634","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"77b67d7e-c849-4dc9-b5fa-7ceb7473378c":{"Title":"Zulu","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"31 Aug 2020","Runtime":"110 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Director":"Jérôme Salle","Writer":"Caryl Ferey, Julien Rappeneau, Jérôme Salle","Actors":"Orlando Bloom, Forest Whitaker, Conrad Kemp","Plot":"As a child, Ali Neuman narrowly escaped being murdered by Inkatha, a militant political party at war with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. Only he and his mother survived the carnage of those years. But as with many survivors, the psychological scars remain. Today, Ali is chief of the homicide branch of the South African police in Cape Town. One of his staff is Brian Epkeen, a free-wheeling white officer whose family was originally involved in the establishment of apartheid but who works well with Neuman. Together they have to deal with crime that inevitably exists in sprawling areas of un- and under- employed people, crime exacerbated by gangs, both local and from other parts of Africa. Their job gets even more difficult when the corpses of two young women are found. A new evil has been introduced in the city and a new drug has been introduced to its residents, including both murder victims. At the chaotic crossroads where brutality and modernization collide, the echoes of apartheid still resound in the shadows of a society struggling toward reconciliation.","Language":"Xhosa, Zulu, English, Afrikaans","Country":"France, South Africa","Awards":"2 wins","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0NjE1OTI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyNTM3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"19,551","imdbID":"tt2249221","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Sep 2020","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"8e973cf6-e6a2-45b5-93ae-44fa90169e3a":null,"0db1685d-26bf-4e5d-b25d-3cc703386f05":{"Title":"Four Corners","Year":"2013","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"28 Mar 2014","Runtime":"119 min","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Director":"Ian Gabriel","Writer":"Hofmeyr Scholtz, Terence Hammond, Ian Gabriel","Actors":"Brendon Daniels, Jezriel Skei, Lindiwe Matshikiza","Plot":"Fatherless and raised by his grandmother, thirteen year old Ricardo Galam lives in South Africa's Cape Flats, a unique and volatile sub culture dominated by two Number gangs, the 26 and 28.

Joy feels that lack of practical support has led to others making fortunes on ideas she came up with years ago but could not act upon manufacturing. Despite being broke, Joy is the person in her extended family to whom everyone has always turned, in the process forgoing her own life, including not having attended college to help see her parents through their divorce. She works in an unsatisfying job as an Eastern Airlines ticket clerk; and lives with her mother Terry who spends all day in bed watching soap operas; her ex-husband Tony, a less than successful aspiring Latino Tom Jones wannabe; and their two children. Added to this mix is her father Rudy, the owner of a failing heavy-duty garage, which is managed by Joy's older half-sister Peggy, with whom she has somewhat of a strained relationship, and for which Joy does the books. Sharon, Rudy's latest girlfriend who has just dumped him, drops him off on Joy's doorstep, making Joy's home life even more complicated as Rudy does not get along with either Terry or Tony. Joy begins to feel buried by her life, in the process her childhood dream of making things seemingly getting farther and farther away. As such, Joy decides to make some changes in her life, and expects the unquestioning practical support of her family. Those changes include manufacturing a new product of her design; what she chooses this time around being a self-wringing mop. That support also includes being able to pitch the idea to Rudy's current wealthy girlfriend, Trudy. Even if she does get to the manufacturing stage, Joy will have to battle the narrow minds of business executives in marketing her product, that is unless she can find a way to get into the homes of the American public in one fell swoop. But nothing is a done deal until the consumer forks out his/her hard earned money for the product and all the legal issues are dealt with. Joy has to decide if she will \"pick up the gun\" as Trudy asked in their initial investment meeting in dealing with an especially troublesome legal issue.","Language":"English, Spanish, French","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 8 wins & 23 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRiOWZmMzUtZTJiOC00MjQ1LTkwMjgtNzhlYzBmODAzYTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"60%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"56/100"}],"Metascore":"56","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"141,928","imdbID":"tt2446980","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Apr 2016","BoxOffice":"$56,451,232","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"d7b5ac3b-b7ff-4742-82ff-64f5fdf20569":{"Title":"The Gambler","Year":"2014","Rated":"R","Released":"25 Dec 2014","Runtime":"111 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Director":"Rupert Wyatt","Writer":"William Monahan, James Toback","Actors":"Mark Wahlberg, Jessica Lange, John Goodman","Plot":"Jim Bennett is a risk taker.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 37 wins & 81 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MThhN2EtZjMzNC00ZDJmLThiZTgtNThlY2UxZWMzNjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"460,632","imdbID":"tt1596363","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$70,259,870","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"bb7831de-01de-44ad-a091-b8ba5904187c":{"Title":"The Wolf of Wall Street","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"25 Dec 2013","Runtime":"180 min","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Crime","Director":"Martin Scorsese","Writer":"Terence Winter, Jordan Belfort","Actors":"Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie","Plot":"In the early 1990s, Jordan Belfort teamed with his partner Donny Azoff and started brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont.

These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there.

In order to do so, she has a secret weapon: she persuades them to join Divine Love, a group of which she is a member with her husband, Danilo who creates flower bouquets at their home. Group readings of holy writings, sermons, purifying immersion: Divine Love has everything you'd find in your average run-of-the-mill evangelical community, except that this group also likes to get involved in a bit of swinging - on the sole condition that the man's seed is reserved for his legitimate wife because \"supreme pleasure comes from the divine desire to procreate life within the family. But Joana and Danilo are unable to conceive, because he is unable to reach a climax, despite his best efforts (swinging upside down on a machine being one of them). As a result, she has entirely dedicated her existence to God in the hope of a miracle (going up to pray regularly at an astonishing religious drive-in). But when the miracle becomes a reality, everything begins to get a little complicated.","Language":"Portuguese","Country":"Brazil, Uruguay, Denmark, Norway, Chile, Sweden","Awards":"5 wins & 25 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM2MDlmYzktMzQ0Ny00NmFkLTlkZWYtY2E0NzgxM2MxNjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkzODUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"86/100"}],"Metascore":"86","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"2,170","imdbID":"tt8311958","Type":"movie","DVD":"14 Sep 2021","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"04c3df43-2551-425c-8349-8b08c615299a":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"f1c6a46d-c1ab-4e47-9eb8-475ec77b0e3e":{"Title":"The Journey","Year":"2012","Rated":"N/A","Released":"12 Oct 2012","Runtime":"15 min","Genre":"Short, Drama","Director":"Hana Makki","Writer":"Sana Bagersh","Actors":"Mylène Gomera, Jamal H.

In what is now a coming-of-death tale, a devastated Sakina is sentenced to mourn her son while he lives - an endeavor her husband could not stand to bear. Growing up under the constant loom of death, Muzamil becomes increasingly curious about what it means to live beyond his mother's confines. Encouraged by local elders, the overprotective Sakina relents and allows her son to study the Quran with the other children his age.

Despite Dennis Dupree, the Bourbon's owner/manager, not liking to hire people like Drew or Sherrie - someone who has musical aspirations - as service staff, Drew is able to convince Dennis and his assistant Lonny to hire Sherrie as a server, Drew and Sherrie who have a blossoming mutual attraction. Dennis and Lonny, who are having financial difficulties, are able to convince rock star Stacee Jaxx, the perpetually stoned front man for the band Arsenal who got his first break performing at the Bourbon, to perform for free at a benefit concert at the club. Rumors are that Stacee is leaving Arsenal after their next gig to go solo, Rolling Stones reporter Constance Sack who wants to get the true story as to the reason. Another problem for the Bourbon is that Mayor Mike Whitmore is taking a tough stance on what he sees as bad societal influences like rock music. His Christian fundamentalist wife Patricia Whitmore is leading the on the ground campaign in this area, she who is determined to shut down the Bourbon. But Patricia is hiding a secret from her past as to the reason for her extreme fervor in getting rid of the Bourbon. As Drew and Sherrie's romance blossoms, other romances around them blossom as well. But their romance and their musical aspirations are threatened by trying to stay true to their musical visions, changing musical tastes, and by Stacee himself.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"2 wins & 8 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NDQyODAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg5MDA3Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"42%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"47/100"}],"Metascore":"47","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"80,493","imdbID":"tt1336608","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 Dec 2015","BoxOffice":"$38,518,613","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"ddc23f68-0144-4ad6-8397-203ebcb0edd7":{"Title":"Extraordinary Tales","Year":"2013","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"23 Oct 2015","Runtime":"73 min","Genre":"Animation, Horror, Mystery","Director":"Raul Garcia","Writer":"Edgar Allan Poe, Raul Garcia, Stéphan Roelants","Actors":"Christopher Lee, Bela Lugosi, Julian Sands","Plot":"An animated anthology of five tales adapted from Edgar Allan Poe's stories.","Language":"English","Country":"France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, United States","Awards":"1 win & 4 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNDI0Njc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4ODA2NTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"58%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"59/100"}],"Metascore":"59","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"3,457","imdbID":"tt3454574","Type":"movie","DVD":"15 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"92f90437-8a72-476d-8b42-249acc3b9a6c":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"60119135-9260-4f03-aa98-bf81f545b360":null,"4954c814-0552-4929-8635-68a7b8fef617":null,"4465b23e-4b68-4620-9252-6625c7259847":null,"1e9829d1-712e-43fc-9930-338b9ee2850a":null,"a1e58e2e-7782-46e9-a200-fce68729ad31":{"Title":"Parker","Year":"2013","Rated":"R","Released":"25 Jan 2013","Runtime":"118 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Director":"Taylor Hackford","Writer":"John J.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 37 wins & 81 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MThhN2EtZjMzNC00ZDJmLThiZTgtNThlY2UxZWMzNjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"460,632","imdbID":"tt1596363","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$70,259,870","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"1d11d509-7084-47fe-bfa1-34147bebf5c1":{"Title":"The Fault in Our Stars","Year":"2014","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"06 Jun 2014","Runtime":"126 min","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Director":"Josh Boone","Writer":"Scott Neustadter, Michael H.

Princess Grace, the former Grace Kelly, has been married to Prince Rainier of Monaco now for five years, they having two young children. Her transition from famed Oscar-winning Hollywood actress from a background as the daughter of a wealthy millionaire owner of a brickworks in Philadelphia to European princess of a small, exclusive and tight-knit principality has been a difficult one, the Monagasques who have been less than welcoming to her in her outspoken American nature. Even in her official charity work as head of a women's committee for the Red Cross, the other committee members largely grumble under their breath about her as their leader. Despite loving Rainier, their marriage is a largely distant one emotionally as he focuses on his role as monarch, now an especially difficult time in the on-going tension between Monaco and France under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle, who would, if he could, annex Monaco back under French control. She has a small entourage of trusted advisers who lead her through the maze of her life, including an American Catholic priest, Father Francis Tucker, currently based in Monaco, and she bringing back into the fold Rupert Allan, who worked as her Hollywood publicist. Despite the unofficial roles of the members of this entourage, Grace has never had official guidance into all that it means to be Princess of Monaco. She has always been courted by the Hollywood community to continue acting, the thoughts of doing so stronger now than ever in her general unhappiness, with a concrete high profile role offered to her by her oft late career collaborator Sir Alfred Hitchcock. She returning to acting would be seen by the Monagasques and probably Rainier as she turning her back on her royal duties. What Grace decides to do under the circumstances takes into account her own happiness, the welfare of their two children who nonetheless will inherit the throne, whether she loves Rainier enough especially in light of an action by France, and whether she sees herself as Princess, and what she can do for the monarchy, the principality, and its subjects in light of her relationship with Rainier.","Language":"English, French, Italian","Country":"Switzerland, France, Italy, Belgium","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Primetime Emmys. 1 win & 5 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjFlY2YxOWEtZWQ1NS00OWZjLWJjZjUtNDBjOGRhYzNhZjM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"9%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"21/100"}],"Metascore":"21","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"20,797","imdbID":"tt2095649","Type":"movie","DVD":"01 Dec 2015","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"129fca73-3de3-4e57-bea5-2c46da783460":null,"a03dfb19-dbce-454e-abaa-53d9b03e6e60":{"Title":"The Nice Guys","Year":"2016","Rated":"R","Released":"20 May 2016","Runtime":"116 min","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Director":"Shane Black","Writer":"Shane Black, Anthony Bagarozzi","Actors":"Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice","Plot":"Set against the backdrop of 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys opens when single father and licensed PI Holland March (Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains.

Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","Language":"English, Spanish, Portuguese","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 65 wins & 132 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg4ZmY1MmItMjFjOS00ZTg2LWJjNDYtNDM2YmM2NzhiNmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzMTY4MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"92/100"}],"Metascore":"92","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"122,380","imdbID":"tt5649144","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Jan 2018","BoxOffice":"$5,904,366","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"160e7728-2887-4cdd-8a7a-4e79d2bd982c":null,"8fb29cca-d102-4ba5-823d-4d3e9f8b76b3":{"Title":"Zombieland: Double Tap","Year":"2019","Rated":"R","Released":"18 Oct 2019","Runtime":"99 min","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Director":"Ruben Fleischer","Writer":"Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Dave Callaham","Actors":"Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone","Plot":"One long decade after the post-apocalyptic events in Zombieland (2009), the resilient quartet of survivors--the tough-as-nails zombie exterminator, Tallahassee; his rule-making comrade, Columbus; the free-spirited huntress, Wichita, and her younger sister, Little Rock--find themselves in the bosom of a now-derelict White House.

Shot from 2016 to 2018, The Cave belongs to the top rank of war films. Syrian director Feras Fayyad takes us to a subterranean landscape that feels akin to the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max (1979). With life too dangerous above ground, survivors create a network of secret tunnels under the city of Ghouta, near Damascus, for an underground hospital maintained by women doctors. In contrast to the many Syrian documentaries made from cellphone footage or shaky cameras, Feras Fayyad takes great care to visualize the landscape and its memorable occupants with artful cinematography. For anyone who feels jaded by Syria coverage, this work stands apart. The heart of the film is Dr. Amani, a young Syrian woman operating in unimaginable conditions with great humor and fortitude. When not tending to patients - many of whom are small children - she's forced to justify her work to chauvinistic men who insist that a woman should be at home fulfilling domestic duties, not running a hospital. The claustrophobia of Amani's workplace is mitigated by the high spirits of her crew, while occasional forays above ground temper relief from close quarters with harrowing scenes of a city reduced to rubble.","Language":"Arabic, English","Country":"Denmark, Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Qatar, Syria","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 21 wins & 23 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiZjcxMmMtZGFhOS00MGU4LTk0YTItZGRmZTc0ZmM2Y2MzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzMjQ0MTA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"83/100"}],"Metascore":"83","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"2,892","imdbID":"tt7178226","Type":"movie","DVD":"14 Jan 2020","BoxOffice":"$62,625","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"b1b3cd3b-95ba-42bd-9419-edd7dbd0b86e":{"Title":"A Perfect Plan","Year":"2020","Rated":"N/A","Released":"01 May 2020","Runtime":"87 min","Genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery","Director":"Jesse D.

Joana, a forty-year-old civil servant, works as a notary at the divorce registration office, but her fervent Christian faith drives her to go beyond her job in an attempt to reconcile separated spouses. In order to do so, she has a secret weapon: she persuades them to join Divine Love, a group of which she is a member with her husband, Danilo who creates flower bouquets at their home. Group readings of holy writings, sermons, purifying immersion: Divine Love has everything you'd find in your average run-of-the-mill evangelical community, except that this group also likes to get involved in a bit of swinging - on the sole condition that the man's seed is reserved for his legitimate wife because \"supreme pleasure comes from the divine desire to procreate life within the family. But Joana and Danilo are unable to conceive, because he is unable to reach a climax, despite his best efforts (swinging upside down on a machine being one of them). As a result, she has entirely dedicated her existence to God in the hope of a miracle (going up to pray regularly at an astonishing religious drive-in). But when the miracle becomes a reality, everything begins to get a little complicated.","Language":"Portuguese","Country":"Brazil, Uruguay, Denmark, Norway, Chile, Sweden","Awards":"5 wins & 25 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM2MDlmYzktMzQ0Ny00NmFkLTlkZWYtY2E0NzgxM2MxNjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkzODUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"86/100"}],"Metascore":"86","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"2,170","imdbID":"tt8311958","Type":"movie","DVD":"14 Sep 2021","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"416b50b1-65c3-4186-bf98-c026d0e650e4":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"9e9a3dbc-bc89-4dbf-b4c2-1ebda5d87599":null,"a6027bad-59b5-427c-95df-b84458b7dd66":null,"c7ccaf56-b803-4f5b-8f78-341cdcce40ba":null,"33ffb531-3f75-4ad7-9bef-ad6be5a54cc9":null,"6fb80600-9475-4de9-b8ab-6d42ccf89120":null,"a0c741b1-dca7-485f-b773-85ace875c94a":null,"b231d8c5-2a37-4903-ba4a-192091f11dea":{"Title":"Hard Paint","Year":"2018","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"06 Dec 2018","Runtime":"117 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Filipe Matzembacher, Marcio Reolon","Writer":"Filipe Matzembacher, Marcio Reolon","Actors":"Shico Menegat, Bruno Fernandes, Guega Peixoto","Plot":"While facing criminal charges, Pedro must grapple with his sister's sudden decision to move away and leave him behind.

She works in an unsatisfying job as an Eastern Airlines ticket clerk; and lives with her mother Terry who spends all day in bed watching soap operas; her ex-husband Tony, a less than successful aspiring Latino Tom Jones wannabe; and their two children.

A former manual worker in a printing press whose job has become obsolete due to the growing use of computers, Mahmoud is at point in his life where he begins to relate to the extinction of dinosaurs. He leads a routine life that revolves around the photocopy shop he owns, his pension, always late, and his neighbors and customers who, like him, are warm and affectionate. Nothing clouds this pretty picture except for the greedy landlord, who harbours no compassion for Mahmoud's financial difficulties, and is constantly nagging him about his late rent. Meanwhile, Mahmoud grapples with developing feelings for his neighbor, Safeya, a widow, who in turn grapples with loneliness. Their budding romance hits many roadblocks, from their advancing years, to Safeya's son's disapproval of the relationship, to Safeya's own troubled feelings towards her femininity after undergoing a mastectomy. We enter the world of these lonely characters, as they approach extinction. And with them, we come to realize that one cannot face the dangers of extinction alone; but only through binding with fellow humans in the face of this metaphorical ice age that threatens to wipe out our humanity, even if humans remain.","Language":"Arabic","Country":"Egypt","Awards":"10 wins & 1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVhNzkwYjAtNzMyYi00MzllLTg2YjctMjA1ZWMxYzE3MDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"1,435","imdbID":"tt7464158","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"41bbe30a-cf01-4a50-a37d-6b50085708bd":{"Title":"Sheikh Jackson","Year":"2017","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"04 Oct 2017","Runtime":"93 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Amr Salama","Writer":"Amr Salama, Omar Khaled","Actors":"Ahmad El-Fishawi, Maged El-Kidwani, Ahmed Malek","Plot":"On the 25th of June 2009, the news of Michael Jackson's death took the world by storm affecting many people, especially an Islamic cleric whose nickname was \"Jackson\" during his school days.

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 3 Oscars. 98 wins & 144 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA5NDZlZGUtMjAxOS00YTRkLTkwYmMtYWQ0NWEwZDZiNjEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"89/100"}],"Metascore":"89","imdbRating":"8.5","imdbVotes":"929,833","imdbID":"tt2582802","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Sep 2016","BoxOffice":"$13,092,000","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"13e8551d-7d79-479f-b828-ffd2445572c3":{"Title":"The Grand Budapest Hotel","Year":"2014","Rated":"R","Released":"28 Mar 2014","Runtime":"99 min","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime","Director":"Wes Anderson","Writer":"Stefan Zweig, Wes Anderson, Hugo Guinness","Actors":"Ralph Fiennes, F.

Only when he has an epiphany does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.","Language":"English, Hindi, Bengali","Country":"Australia, United Kingdom, United States, India","Awards":"Nominated for 6 Oscars. 59 wins & 110 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NjkzNjg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyMzgzMDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"69/100"}],"Metascore":"69","imdbRating":"8.0","imdbVotes":"244,971","imdbID":"tt3741834","Type":"movie","DVD":"01 Apr 2017","BoxOffice":"$51,738,905","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"e4ecc416-23e6-4f61-a487-a2c1b0d7ef34":null,"2ddda84b-b8ea-4717-ae97-5a987b998a21":null,"14fd4736-329f-446d-87fd-2d9356aa431b":null,"081fd8ff-76f9-460c-9abf-db14fd994ad5":null,"f6b0c665-8b8d-4e2b-a764-cc3bba510222":null,"595a30de-2745-4072-886c-52a54670457c":null,"2dc01ecc-e89d-4e71-8cb8-df5ce25f416d":null,"93df328d-b97f-4ee3-8760-883a9fe04d69":null,"23e24a13-ad81-440f-8063-f4a7366c9b98":null,"699cfc7a-ffef-4396-9bd7-813d69f3aeca":null,"b8c223ac-b0a3-4fbd-8ae3-76c6b634b1b0":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"b9a82302-aa2e-4d48-a70b-34051956962b":null,"6f962cef-51e6-4f27-afb1-e7b8566f0c7c":{"Title":"Babyteeth","Year":"2019","Rated":"MA-17","Released":"19 Jun 2020","Runtime":"118 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Director":"Shannon Murphy","Writer":"Rita Kalnejais","Actors":"Eliza Scanlen, Michelle Lotters, Toby Wallace","Plot":"When seriously ill teenager Milla falls madly in love with smalltime drug dealer Moses, it's her parents' worst nightmare. But as Milla's first brush with love brings her a new lust for life, things get messy and traditional morals go out the window. Milla soon shows everyone in her orbit - her parents, Moses, a sensitive music teacher, a budding child violinist, and a disarmingly honest pregnant neighbour - how to live like you have nothing to lose. What might have been a disaster for the Finlay family instead leads to letting go and finding grace in the glorious chaos of life. Babyteeth joyously explores how good it is not to be dead yet and how far we will go for love.","Language":"English","Country":"Australia","Awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award30 wins & 29 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRhMzRkYzEtMDBjNy00YjkxLWJjNzctNzEwNGNhZDUyZWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE1MzI2NzIz._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"77/100"}],"Metascore":"77","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"18,126","imdbID":"tt8399664","Type":"movie","DVD":"18 Jun 2020","BoxOffice":"$4,507","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"},"f65a05fe-b76c-4637-b123-04e8f2f114f0":null,"3644cb9e-a71b-4964-8158-129c01ecb016":null,"9efaf880-739a-4130-aa37-0a6517978415":{"Response":"False","Error":"Movie not found!"},"8ce19962-9e85-4ba9-89bd-e61d84baa13d":null,"575bc195-17d4-4f16-8c9d-3dcb9643d220":null,"f5f6175c-0152-4c27-b7f6-8be4884f2acb":null,"6ba7fc81-a58b-4bcd-bef0-9d60afa3d383":null,"a47cf02b-4fe9-4df1-8475-193d928f926e":null,"6b071d10-051e-4727-a61f-74ab76e73700":null,"f2a9250d-8f32-4fe4-96cc-107bcbc09599":null,"91477d61-19e0-44c9-bc1b-93ee0d4559b3":null,"615c0314-5e2e-478c-8939-9b7131be8004":null,"f7c8b932-e344-4a2c-85be-b05d9668d1a0":null,"70573325-0fb3-4a93-bae9-3679707beab2":null,"6c9b3775-bcb1-460f-9531-84a25fb81a11":null,"700d6003-e3ba-40ff-babc-256d6aadbc42":null,"4ee6e364-6762-4bcf-a811-c77f7ad25a8b":null,"6760a691-2a0b-4ea1-b788-eac39bf81588":null,"26936632-1011-4035-ba11-238bfae5ac22":null,"59abbd91-a8c3-4ebc-9734-de627281de06":null,"7800cc09-b6fd-4bef-8c04-56378b7dd2f2":null,"c0179e2a-6cc5-4fb5-836d-b6124579d15c":null,"2a70e37e-0f6d-4d72-b4fa-da7c293bc448":null,"d77b9fc9-6844-485a-898e-86959ee06e0b":null,"554010ec-c8b5-48f4-ab3c-414cee3e38ea":null,"bb66c72a-0bf1-4378-b48f-f0db994a9749":null,"85381370-02c8-4409-b01e-5af9538a3b84":null,"50f2c9ef-6fe3-44ff-97ee-7d77d9faf3f8":null,"a329b8a7-07ce-4d6e-87ea-29f1afbb072e":null,"e7d9a9c9-bc78-49f9-94ab-559c70608380":null,"956accd5-f3e4-4d38-9de8-f3c221988ba1":null,"13412cb4-5e54-4388-8ab9-36fda47dda73":null,"904be8f3-52d5-4cc7-803d-83f32e93e9b7":null,"bee82a5c-442e-429c-aff5-fd33b473f261":null,"4627c111-4bf3-46fd-a037-e87ac756bd34":null,"b5d8f7c7-68b4-44b7-9973-faee2ae9b58a":null,"4d770285-916b-4f07-a4ee-f5b654d6424f":null,"0a5c1ffe-5aa5-4667-b9b1-6c991209b6d1":null,"84be0025-7b19-41fb-96a8-fe2a23617a19":null,"dbbb352e-82a6-4469-a7ef-5b9dea200e31":null,"032002ea-2eac-40cd-8f98-0c3c7da1eb91":null,"465487ad-3b91-4b53-9d7b-3f4e9f7aff9d":null,"435b71b2-736e-4991-a384-066d2af8f9f2":null,"8600d5b8-9351-47bc-848c-5c5a1f16b25a":null,"60a2dcd3-c48f-434d-b429-297082b8567f":null,"7ac0b97d-ed72-44a6-9a26-4594fc3ba856":null,"9f5629c6-98f0-47e2-86b2-fb6ec24fada6":null,"a5b34192-3835-400a-a87c-d0f3a9ec86c1":null,"48c1f6ec-0a1c-49dc-aefe-9704af686762":null,"0a4a9e3b-0738-4879-a584-a05cce8ed27c":null,"6006121e-0426-4200-bee0-e98b5eacf6ee":null,"b3b1bc85-195d-47b9-90dc-90e4381d69bb":null,"6a9ceb07-5ce7-463a-9908-63520891eb79":null,"322a1e72-a69e-47dc-9f19-3a254a79b938":null,"2818a61f-2a68-42ad-94e4-b6106d54a6ed":null,"55c8ccd7-4799-4e49-b166-de420a5a4d75":null,"eedf2e13-7c56-4019-ae10-983dbbde9782":null,"0b190db9-a607-4f3f-9350-c235c65df37c":null,"115e3c4e-9c9a-4f49-9f4d-e53a6a43f560":null,"c20c794a-b41b-4eab-b247-ce043b9bc222":null,"7657a014-8a76-4c34-b145-9bad67da3def":null,"4207b6f3-3c82-4e61-a171-0d827cfbc6ff":null,"67f3336d-449e-4f9b-b0e4-aad914b93d74":null,"21b8f1e8-e4c7-4c49-a247-b49b5edeec77":null,"1051a9c9-4d2f-4258-902f-838029425f94":null,"c658cccb-912c-422b-b4b3-1ba2c89aa834":null,"b03fe9fa-56a6-4d17-84da-746f65bb2ee7":null,"ba0f5038-b118-49d5-97a4-91e76a023fc9":null,"6345efb4-dfdd-4c38-bf12-c4ce99eb01af":null,"e8ff1964-4a95-45de-946b-3a2fa391702b":null,"8a8b9f8f-45c7-4786-a7a4-f70e319f6584":null,"e665353d-ec2d-48d8-a80d-797967df1c46":null,"5d28aec5-f401-45c9-aeb4-47c705299f4a":null,"1a6bf5e8-fc27-4c51-8939-a0081ebb710b":{"Title":"It","Year":"2017","Rated":"R","Released":"08 Sep 2017","Runtime":"135 min","Genre":"Horror","Director":"Andy Muschietti","Writer":"Chase Palmer, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Gary Dauberman","Actors":"Bill Skarsgård, Jaeden Martell, Finn Wolfhard","Plot":"In the Town of Derry, the local kids are disappearing one by one.
